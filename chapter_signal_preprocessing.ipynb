    "I have created a proof of concept of dataset compression [here](notebooks/downsampling_signals.ipynb) through downsampling from 2.5Hz to 0.5Hz without noticable loss of signal information. This showed that downsampling with mean aggregation reduced dataset size by 90% without noticable change in signal shape.  Whatsmore, I found that raw signals required an initial resampling to their current frequency to smooth out local irregularities, that 0 - 20 mins is the most interesting (and easiest to work with) range, and that Euclidean distance is an appropriate and intuitive measure of change during downsampling."
