    "What follows is a quick tutorial on using [patchworklib](https://pypi.org/project/patchworklib/) v0.6.2 to combine a seaborn Axes level plot and a Figure level plot for simultaneous display. The Motivation stems from the desire to construct 'dashboards' of plots on the fly, for example density plots alongside correlation, or relational plots alongside violin plots, as displayed below. Unfortunately, seaborn does not support natively combining Figure level plots with other figures through the matplotlib subfigure API at this time, and other methods that i have experimented with thus far have proved insufficient.\n",

    "Overall I am happy with the design of this library, but as I said earlier, it is not user-friendly. The documentation needs serious work, and what is currently stopping me from using it is that the display appears to be using its own default themes including transparent backgrounds, making them unusable in dark themes. Hopefully the dev adds documentation or clearer setting handling in the future."
