## 3.05

Signal alignment is a nessary stage in the statistical processing of chemical data as misalignment introduces extranous variation that can peturb modles such as PCA. Causes of peak shift include: temperature changes, pressure differences, viscosity differences, pH differences, matrix effects, problems during recording, problems in the instrument. Unfortunately, higher resolution exacerbates the problem, as a growing number of significant figures inreases the range of possible values a signal can possess.

Chromatographic separations depend primarily on molecule charge, size, or polarity. Unfortunately, tertiary effects from: sample phase decomposition, matrix effects, temperature changes, heterogenous mobile phase composition, instrumental drift, analyte interaction, pressure fluctuation, flow rate fluctuation, or gas bubbles can change the retention characteristic of a molecule run on run. This results in an ultimately unpredictable and inconsistant peak position within a sample set, driving the need for peak alignment methods.
