    "\n",
    "### Sample Provenence\n",
    "\n",
    "All samples were collected between February and May 2023, primarily from [Shell House](https://shellhouse.com.au/), with contributions from [Alberto's Lounge](https://swillhouse.com/venues/albertos-lounge/), and [The Bottle Shop - Bondi](https://merivale.com/the-bottle-shop/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nature of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As wines were sampled as they came in, there was little control over the distribution of samples. Thus, the first question to ask is how many samples were detected by each method, how many individual wines are within the dataset, how many are repetitions, and how many wines have repetitions. Following this, the next question is the distribution of wine characteristics, the most important of which are wine *type*, *variety*, and *country* of origin. The answer to these questions is explored below.\n",

    "In summary, the dataset is dominated by Australian reds with Shiraz and Pinot Noir as the top contenders, and Chardonany as the primary white varietal. The distribution of categories between the datasets is roughly equal, any variation is in part due to the seasonality of wine consumption and the sample source.\n",
