# Paper: Post Column Derivitization Detection of Red and White Wines with CUPRAC

## Back Links

[homepage_mres_thesis](../homepage_mres_thesis.md)

[[2023-06-04]]

## Summary

A paper/thesis chapter discussing:

- separation of red and white wines through HPLC
- detection of wines through UV/vis spectrometry.
- detection of those sames wines through CUPRAC PCD [[spectrophotometry]].
- Why the signal magnitudes differ between the PCD and raw signals.
- Which is better for the intended purpose, i.e. [[chemotaxonomy]].

Notes from meeting

Similarities

1. Seperate out most represented classes

subset the data, save some.

Chapter 1: description of dataset
Chapter 2: dataset robustness, library validation
Chapter 3: 

Column Selectivity

wine degredation
- normalize on a peak


Standards:
- uv and cuprac

## Questions for Andrew Regarding this Paper

- How much to focus on WHY the profiles look the way they do
- What descriptive elements to compare the signals (i.e. peak tables)
