This section will cover the resiveolution enhancement of a signal through transformation by the addition/subtraction of its derivatives.
 
- [ ] what is meant by resolution enhancement
- [ ] why would you want/need to increase the resolution of a signal
- [ ] what are common methods of signal resolution enhancement
- [ ] what is the derivative of a signal
- [ ] What patterns are present through an increasing derivative order
- [ ] how does adding or subtracting a derivative modify the signal
- [ ] how does adding/subtracting different derivatives affect the signal
- [ ] What are common algorithms in the literature, what are their advantages and disadvantages.
