An outline of reading notes from the article follows.

# Abstract

- the scale of data from automated scientific experiments is too large to use intuitive methods, rather, it is necessary to develop mathematical methods to do the same thing unsupervised.
  - differentiation and filtering main examples of this.
- filtering can be achieved through signal processing methods, but least squares can be applied also and is considered simpler.
- least squares methods are applied by convolution of samples with sets of integers possessing normalizing factors.
- This has applications in spectroscopy.
- the authors demonstrate the program in FORTRAN.

# introduction

- Noise is present in any quantitative information and is indistinguishable from information
- it is important to remove the noise.
- most experiments involve univariate data
- The authors are addressing how to automate the removal of random noise and evaluation of the first few derivatives with respect to the abscissa ($x$).
- requirements of the technique:
  - constant dx.
  - curves must be continuous and smooth.

## Alternative Methods

- The moving average is a method of smoothing data.
  - procedure:
    1. select a window
    2. add the ordinates
    3. divide by number of points - gives the ordinate of the center of the group
    4. store that value
    5. move the window foreward one sample, perform again.
- another is through the 'convolute' and of a 'convolution function'
  - two set of numbers are placed parallel on a space, see @convolution_operation:
    - the left are the ordinates
    - the right the abscissa.
    - through the middle moves a window, which contains:
      - a set of abscissa ranging from -2 to +2 on its left side
      - a set of convoluting integers on the right $C$
    - for the moving average, each $C=1$ (?)
    - a convolution of the ordinate numbers with the set of convoluting integers is performed by:
      - each number in the block is multiplied by the corresponding number in the table of data
      - the results are added
      - sum is divided by 5.
    - ergo the moving average is calculated by convolution
    - In this example, $C$ can be referred to as the *convoluting function*, and the denominator is the *normalizing factor*.
    - in the same manner as earlier, the window is moved through the data, convoluting all of it.
  - this concept can be generalised.
  - any convolution function has an associated normalizing (scaling) factor.
  - formal definition:
    - $Y_j^*=\frac{\sum^{i=m}_{i=-m}C_iY_{j+1}}{N}$
      - where $j$ is the index of the ordinate in the input data
  - The set of all ones as the convoluting function IS the moving average.
  - but the moving average is not ideal in all cases - for example it will degrade sharp peaks.
  - Other common smoothing functions include the exponential function, symmetrical triangular function, symmetrical exponential function.
    - all of these work by giving the weights different values according to a function. For example the exponential function allocates weighting according to exponential decay away from the sample in question.
