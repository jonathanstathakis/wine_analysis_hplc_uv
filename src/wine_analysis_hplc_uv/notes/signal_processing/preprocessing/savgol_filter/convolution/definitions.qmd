From [@smith.ChapterLinearSystems.1997, sec. Signals and Systems, pp. 87]:
    - "a signal is a description of how one parameter varies with another parameter".
    - "a system is a process that produces an output signal in response to an input signal".
    - a continuous system takes continuous input and produces continuous output.
    - a discrete system takes continuout input and produces continuout output.
