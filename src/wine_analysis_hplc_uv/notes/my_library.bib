  abstract = {A novel approach for the analysis of phenolics in tea was developed using multiplexed simultaneous detection. This is the first study employing a short reaction flow (RF) chromatography column (length 50 mm) for the analysis of phenolics in complex samples (not a standard mixture of compounds). RF separation efficiency was high as the detectors are multiplexed simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The delay time between RF detection responses is minor (1.2 s) providing simple peak assignment between the phenolic detection and conventional detectors, such as the UV and fluorescence detectors (FLD). Thirty-nine phenolics were detected amongst the five different tea samples (three from Camellia sinensis and two herbal teas). The highest number of phenols detected was 24 for English Breakfast tea (four highly abundant), 19 for Earl Grey (six highly abundant), 13 in Pure Green (two highly abundant) and 9 in both Fruit of the Forest (two highly abundant) and Camomile (none highly abundant) herbal teas. Numerous low concentration phenolic compounds in the Fruit of the Forest tea were not included due to their abundance being only slightly above the noise level of the detection process. The relative response factor (RRF) analysed at 520 and 500 nm aided to identify unique phenolics to each sample with similar retention times; three phenolics were unique to the Pure Green tea (2.30, 4.11 and 5.80 min) and two to the Earl Grey Tea (4.11 and 5.80 The Fruit of the Forest tea and the Camomile tea were both distinctly different from all other teas.

Detailed assessment of the peaks (based largely on retention time) that were observed in both detection modes for five beverage samples (four teas and one coffee) revealed the presence of a total of 56 compounds. Eight compounds were not detected by the FRAP assay and 13 were not observed by the phenolic assay. A geometric approach to factor analysis (GAFA) was applied to the detection sensitivity, and this analysis showed the correlation between these two assays was 0.67 and the spreading angle between the detection vectors was 47. Such outcomes are usually indicative of a multidimensional separation approach, but in this study this was achieved only from the detection protocol. Hence, when employing PCD to determine the 'activity' of samples derived from natural origin, testing should be conducted using multiple selective detection processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A reaction flow (RF) HPLC column (30 mm x 2.1 mm internal diameter (i.d.), 3 mu m particle diameter) enabled the selective detection of phenols for both a simple standard mixture and a complex sample represented by green tea. The resolving power and sensitivity obtained were similar to an analytical scale (4.6 mm i.d.) RF HPLC column of the same format. However, the baseline noise experienced was higher when the assay was scaled down from the RF 4.6 mm i.d. to the RF 2.1 mm i.d. narrow bore column. The PCD mixing and reaction speed inside the RF column outlet (frit and head-fitting design) enabled the coupling of PCD protocols with "UHPLC-type" low volume columns and systems without significant loss in separation performance. In comparison to a conventional analytical scale PCD approach the scaled down narrow bore RF approach demonstrated 40 times greater sensitivity in terms of S/N. Scaled down PCD is vital for decreased consumption and cost without significant loss in separation performance.},

However, finding an applicable methodology that would consider the various aspects of adulteration remains a challenge. This study investigated an ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy-based determination of caffeine and chlorogenic acid contents, as well as the applicability of non-targeted near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, to discriminate between green coffee beans of the Coffea arabica (Arabica) and Coffea canephora (Robusta) species from Java Island, Indonesia. The discrimination was conducted by measuring the caffeine and chlorogenic acid content in the beans using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The data related to both compounds was processed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Information about the diffuse reflectance (log 1/R) spectra of intact beans was determined by NIR spectroscopy and analyzed using multivariate analysis. UV-Vis spectroscopy attained an accuracy of 97\% in comparison to NIR spectroscopy’s accuracy by selected wavelengths of LDA (95\%). The study suggests that both methods are applicable to discriminate reliably among species.},

Several studies have proposed different methods for detecting adulterated honey. Traditional methods, such as stable carbon isotope ratio analysis, chromatography, and physicochemical parameter analysis, provided good qualitative and quantitative detection. These technologies utilize different approaches, such as profiles of honey constituents, physical and chemical properties of honey, and specific marker traces for the sugar adulterants. Spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging provided fast and nondestructive detection with no sample preparation. Sensory techniques, such as low-cost optic fiber sensors, demonstrated their effectiveness in quantifying honey adulteration. This paper discusses various technologies for detecting and quantifying honey adulteration. We also discuss the machine learning models and their performance in this research.},

  abstract = {Selectivity of phase system is of primary concern when designing a bidimensional chromatographic system and looking for the highest degree of orthogonality between the two separations. Several statistical or geometrical criteria can potentially be used to measure the degree of orthogonality. A comparison of eight candidate criteria has been carried out in this study. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the relevance of each criterion and its ability to reveal the significance of the influence of factors like pH, stationary phase, and organic modifier. Experimentally, a set of 32 chromatographic systems was evaluated by the same generic gradient with 63 probe solutes, likely to be present in biological and/or environmental samples and covering a wide range of physico-chemical properties: acidic, basic and neutral compounds with different pKa, molecular mass and hydrophobicity (logP). Each chromatographic system was defined by the nature of the stationary phase (8 different silica or grafting chemistries), the pH of the aqueous fraction of the mobile phase (2.5 or 7.0) and the nature of the organic modifier (acetonitrile or methanol). The orthogonality of the 496 couples of chromatographic systems was evaluated and ranked using the eight different approaches: the three correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall), two geometric criteria characterizing the coverage of the 2D separation space, Slonecker's information similarity and two chi-square statistics of independence between normalized retention times. In fact, there were only seven distinct criteria, since we established the analytical equivalence between the rankings with the likelihood ratio statistics and Slonecker's information similarity. Kendall's correlation coefficient appeared to be the best measure of orthogonality since, according to ANOVA, it exhibited the highest sensitivity to all experimental factors. The chi-square measures, and hence Slonecker's information similarity, performed equally well provided the discretization of the separation space was carried out appropriately. Finally, from the compared study of the factors acting upon orthogonality carried out by ANOVA, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the pH of the mobile phases has the highest impact on the selectivity followed by the type of stationary phase and finally by the organic modifier.},

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds are of crucial importance for red wine color and mouthfeel attributes. A large number of enzymatic and chemical reactions involving phenolic compounds take place during winemaking and aging. Despite the large number of published analytical methods for phenolic analyses, the values obtained may vary considerably. In addition, the existing scientific knowledge needs to be updated, but also critically evaluated and simplified for newcomers and wine industry partners. The most used and widely cited spectrophotometric methods for grape and wine phenolic analysis were identified through a bibliometric search using the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE) database accessed through the Web of Science (WOS) platform from Thompson Reuters. The selection of spectrophotometry was based on its ease of use as a routine analytical technique. On the basis of the number of citations, as well as the advantages and disadvantages reported, the modified Somers assay appears as a multistep, simple, and robust procedure that provides a good estimation of the state of the anthocyanins equilibria. Precipitation methods for total tannin levels have also been identified as preferred protocols for these types of compounds. Good reported correlations between methods (methylcellulose precipitable vs bovine serum albumin) and between these and perceived red wine astringency, in combination with the adaptation to high-throughput format, make them suitable for routine analysis. The bovine serum albumin tannin assay also allows for the estimation of the anthocyanins content with the measurement of small and large polymeric pigments. Finally, the measurement of wine color using the CIELab space approach is also suggested as the protocol of choice as it provides good insight into the wine’s color properties.},

Food science and technology applications use chemical data and are therefore suitable for chemometrics evaluation. Bibliometric studies provide an enhanced understanding of the progression, research status as well as future trends of a research field. The main aim of the study was therefore, to provide a bibliometric evaluation of the research literature employing chemometrics techniques in food science and technology applications. For this, a search strategy including the single term chemometric* was performed. The metadata obtained from the bibliometric search was subsequently analyzed. Indicators of the scientific productivity and quality such as the number of articles, citations, or funding activity, were obtained in combination with the most relevant keywords, authors, and countries. The progression over time of the bibliometric indicators was also presented and discussed. Chemometrics appeared as a prolific and healthy research field with increased funding received in the last decade. PCA, PLS and DA are still the preferred methods for most applications. A big part of the research is related to the combined use of spectroscopy and chemometrics. Finally, China and Brazil appeared as the leading countries in applying chemometrics to foodstuffs.},

Here, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy coupled with a partial least squares regression (PLSR) chemometric tool was used for the detection of the misuse of such substances. Bambuterol and its metabolite terbutaline have been included in the list of prohibited doping agents. Therefore, we used bambuterol and terbutaline as models for the accurate and simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of bambuterol and terbutaline in human urine samples. The method was straightforward and once the urine samples were collected, they could be directly applied to the surface of the ZnSe prism (ATR unit) to get the results within one minute. A calibration set with a partial factorial design was used to develop the PLSR model that could be used to predict the concentration of unknown samples containing the two drugs. The developed method was carefully validated and successfully applied to the urine sample analysis of human volunteers. The drugs were quantified at nanogram level concentrations. A side-by-side comparison of the proposed method with the routine GC-MS method was performed to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of each method.},

  abstract = {Owing to the importance of antioxidants in the protection of both natural and man-made materials, a large variety of testing methods have been proposed and applied. These include methods based on inhibited autoxidation studies, which are better followed by monitoring the kinetics of oxygen consumption or of the formation of hydroperoxides, the primary oxidation products. Analytical determination of secondary oxidation products (e.g. carbonyl compounds) has also been used. The majority of testing methods, however, do not involve substrate autoxidation. They are based on the competitive bleaching of a probe (e.g. ORAC assay, β-carotene, crocin bleaching assays, and luminol assay), on reaction with a different probe (e.g. spin-trapping and TOSC assay), or they are indirect methods based on the reduction of persistent radicals (e.g. galvinoxyl, DPPH and TEAC assays), or of inorganic oxidizing species (e.g. FRAP, CUPRAC and Folin-Ciocalteu assays). Yet other methods are specific for preventive antioxidants. The relevance, advantages, and limitations of these methods are critically discussed, with respect to their chemistry and the mechanisms of antioxidant activity. A variety of cell-based assays have also been proposed, to investigate the biological activity of antioxidants. Their importance and critical aspects are discussed, along with arguments for the selection of the appropriate testing methods according to the different needs.},

  abstract = {Background:Young researchers may experience difficulties when writing scientific articles for publication in biomedical journals. Various methods may facilitate the writing process including outlining the paper before the actual writing and using dictation instead of writing the first draft. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and difficulties for young, experienced researchers when writing articles using a detailed outline and dictation of the first draft.Methods:We used qualitative focus group interviews and the study was reported according to the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research guideline. Participants were sampled from a group of researchers participating in a writing retreat/course. The interviews were recorded on a digital recorder and transcribed. The text was analyzed according to content analysis and coded and condensed into themes and subthemes. Groups of participants were added until data saturation was reached.Results:A total of 14 researchers participated (9 women and 5 men). Their clinical experience was median (range) of 6 (1?11)?years since graduation from medical school. Two themes arose during the analyses of the data: ?Process guidance with the outline as the map? and ?arrival at dictation.? The outline was used in the preparation phase leading up to the day of dictation and was used in collaboration with co-authors and supervisors. The participants found it to be a useful tool for preparing the manuscript and dictating their initial first full draft.Conclusion:Experienced young researchers found beneficial effects of using a structured outline to prepare for dictation of scientific articles. The outline was a tool that would develop in close collaboration with co-authors and mentors. With dictation, a full first draft of a manuscript can be produced in a few hours. Participants positively evaluated this structured and reproducible way of producing scientific articles.},

  title = {The {{Australian Code}} for the {{Responsible Conduct}} of {{Research}}},
  author = {{arc}},
  date = {2018},
  publisher = {{National Health and Medical Research Council}},
  abstract = {The Australian and international community expects research to be conducted responsibly, ethically and with integrity. The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (the Code) articulates the broad principles that characterise an honest, ethical and conscientious research culture. It establishes a framework for responsible research conduct that provides a foundation for high-quality research, credibility and community trust in the research endeavour. It outlines the expectations for the conduct of research in Australia or research conducted under the auspices of Australian institutions. The primary responsibility for ensuring the integrity of research lies with individual researchers and institutions. The Code sets out principles and responsibilities that both researchers and institutions are expected to follow when conducting research. Critical to this endeavour are the moral leadership and espoused values of the institution and the shared values and expectations of honesty and integrity that characterise an institution’s leadership and culture. The previous version of the Code has served as an important point of reference to researchers and administrators. In addition, its widespread adoption has provided the Australian community, and those responsible for funding research, with greater confidence in the integrity of research. This updated version of the Code has the same goal, but is presented in a simpler way that more clearly articulates the high-level principles, responsibilities and expectations that apply to all research across all disciplines. This Code does not incorporate the laws, regulations and guidelines and other codes of practice that apply to the conduct of research. Those responsible for the conduct of research are expected to be aware of and comply with the applicable laws and codes. The Code will be supported by a number of Guides that detail how to comply with the principles and responsibilities of the Code. The advice is relevant to the diversity of Australian research institutions and research disciplines. Institutions and researchers are strongly encouraged to follow the advice in the Guides. For institutions, the Guides provide a reference for the development of processes that promote the principles and responsibilities of the Code. The Code represents the core behaviours that characterise the responsible conduct of research. A failure to meet the principles and responsibilities set out in the Code is a breach of the Code. A breach of the Code occurs on a spectrum from minor breaches to those that are more serious. A serious breach of the Code that is carried out with intent or recklessness or negligence is particularly egregious and may be referred to as research misconduct. The Guide to Managing and Investigating Potential Breaches of the Code (the Investigation Guide) outlines the preferred model for institutions to use to investigate and manage potential breaches, determine any corrective actions to ensure the integrity of the research record and when a finding of research misconduct may be made. The Australian Research Integrity Committee will use the Investigation Guide as a benchmark for reviewing how an institution funded by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) or Australian Research Council (ARC) has managed a potential breach of the Code. Compliance with this Code is a requirement for the receipt of funding by NHMRC and ARC. Other research agencies are encouraged to adopt this Code as a mandatory requirement.},

Their presence in food affects food quality parameters such as astringency, bitterness, sourness, sweetness, salivary viscosity, aroma, and color formation. The ability of flavan-3-ols to aid food functionality has also been established in terms of microbial stability, foamability, oxidative stability, and heat stability. While some foods only contain monomeric flavan-3-ols [(-)-epicatechin predominates] and dimeric proanthocyanidins, most foods contain oligomers of degree of polymerization values ranging from 1-10 or greater than 10. Flavan-3-ols have been reported to exhibit several health beneficial effects by acting as antioxidant, anticarcinogen, cardiopreventive, antimicrobial, anti-viral, and neuro-protective agents. This review summarizes the distribution and health effects of these compounds.},

Acylated derivatives, particularly of malvidin-3-glucoside, appeared as key factors in this characterisation. Thus, malvidin 3-acetyl-glucoside was the variable with the largest discriminating power in the differentiation of varieties. Larger relative concentrations in this compound were found in the wines of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, a neat separation of wines according to production area is obtained in terms of their relative contents of the P-coumaric acid ester of malvidin 3-glucoside.},

  abstract = {As the conversation in higher education shifts from diversity to inclusion, the attrition rates of students in the STEM fields continue to be a point of discussion. Combined with the demand for expansion in the STEM workforce, various retention reforms have been proposed, implemented, and in some cases integrated into policy following evidence of success. Still, new findings, technological advances, and socio-cultural shifts inevitably necessitate an ongoing investigation as to how students approach learning. Among other factors, students who enter college without effective study skills are at much greater risk of being unsuccessful in their coursework. In order to construct an equitable learning environment, a mechanism must be developed to provide underprepared students with access to resources or interventions designed to refine the skills they need to be successful in the course. Early, reliable assessments can provide predictions of individual student outcomes in order to guide the development and implementation of such targeted interventions. In the present study, a model is developed to predict students’ odds of success based on their study approaches, as measured by their responses to twelve survey items from an existing instrument used in the Chemistry Education Research literature designed to measure students’ deep and surface learning approaches. The model’s prediction specificity ranges from 66.5\% to 86.9\% by semester. Two distinct sets of lower-performing students are identified in the data: those who align predominantly with surface approaches to learning versus those who indicate using both deep and surface approaches to learning. This supports the idea of a tailored approach to interventions, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Results from this instrument were correlated to students’ reported study methods and beliefs.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised exploratory data analysis (EDA) is often the first step in understanding complex data sets. While summary statistics are among the most efficient and convenient tools for exploring and describing sets of data, they are often overlooked in EDA. In this paper, we show multiple case studies that compare the performance, including clustering, of a series of summary statistics in EDA. The summary statistics considered here are pattern recognition entropy (PRE), the mean, standard deviation (STD), 1-norm, range, sum of squares (SSQ), and X4, which are compared with principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate curve resolution (MCR), and/or cluster analysis. PRE and the other summary statistics are direct methods for analyzing data—they are not factor-based approaches. To quantify the performance of summary statistics, we use the concept of the “critical pair,” which is employed in chromatography. The data analyzed here come from different analytical methods. Hyperspectral images, including one of a biological material, are also analyzed. In general, PRE outperforms the other summary statistics, especially in image analysis, although a suite of summary statistics is useful in exploring complex data sets. While PRE results were generally comparable to those from PCA and MCR, PRE is easier to apply. For example, there is no need to determine the number of factors that describe a data set. Finally, we introduce the concept of divided spectrum-PRE (DS-PRE) as a new EDA method. DS-PRE increases the discrimination power of PRE. We also show that DS-PRE can be used to provide the inputs for the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm. We recommend PRE and DS-PRE as rapid new tools for unsupervised EDA.},

  abstract = {Introduction Polygoni Orientalis Fructus (POF) is a clinically effective Chinese medicine. Raw POF (RPOF) and POF Tostus (POFT) are used separately in clinics. However, incomplete progress has been made on quality control. Objective To establish a comprehensive method for quality assessment of RPOF and POFT and to discriminate these two varieties. Methodology High-performance liquid chromatography combined with the diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) methods were developed for fingerprinting and quantitative analysis of seven major compounds in RPOF and POFT, and the main components were determined by HPLC-DAD coupled with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. Chemometric approaches were performed to discriminate RPOF and POFT and to screen discriminatory components. Results Fingerprints were established and 12 common peaks were identified, cannabisin G and cannabisin E were firstly identified from POF. In quantitative analysis, all analytes showed good regression (R {$>$} 0.9996) within test ranges and the recovery of the method was in the range 96.6-104.3\%. Fingerprints in conjunction with similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) demonstrated the consistent quality of RPOF and showed a clear discrimination between RPOF and POFT. Principal component analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis, and heatmap-HCA on quantitative data not only gave a clear differentiation between RPOF and POFT, but they also suggested that quercetin, 3,5,7-trihydroxychromone, and N-trans-feruloyltyramine acted as the main factors responsible for the sample differences. Conclusions Chromatographic analysis in combination with chemometric analysis provides a simple and reliable method of comparing and evaluating the qualities of RPOF and POFT.},

  abstract = {Adulteration in food has been a concern since the beginning of civilization, as it not only decreases the quality of food products but also results in a number of ill effects on health. Authentic testing of food and adulterant detection of various food products is required for value assessment and to assure consumer protection against fraudulent activities. Through this review we intend to compile different types of adulterations made in different food items, the health risks imposed by these adulterants and detection methods available for them. Concerns about food safety and regulation have ensured the development of various techniques like physical, biochemical/immunological and molecular techniques, for adulterant detection in food. Molecular methods are more preferable when it comes to detection of biological adulterants in food, although physical and biochemical techniques are preferable for detection of other adulterants in food.},

On-chip chromatography finds applications in genomics, proteomics, biomarker discovery, and environmental analysis. Microfluidics-based chromatography has good reproducibility and small sample consumption. However, the on-chip chromatography fabrication techniques are often more challenging to perform than conventional LC column preparation. Different research groups have attempted to develop different techniques to fabricate microfluidics-based LC systems.

  abstract = {During the last two decades, near and mid-infrared spectral analyses have emerged as a reliable and promising analytical tool for objective assessment of coffee quality attributes. The literature presented in this review clearly reveals that near and mid-infrared approaches have a huge potential for gaining rapid information about the chemical composition and related properties of coffee. In addition to its ability for effectively quantifying and characterising quality attributes of some important features of coffee such as moisture, lipids and caffeine content, classification into quality grades and determination of sensory attributes, it is able to measure multiple chemical constituents simultaneously avoiding extensive sample preparation. Developing a quality evaluation system based on infrared spectral information to assess the coffee quality parameters and to ensure its authentication would bring economical benefits to the coffee industry by increasing consumer confidence in the quality of products. This paper provides an overview of the recently developed approaches and latest research carried out in near and mid-infrared spectral technology for evaluating the quality and composition of coffee and the possibility of its widespread deployment.},

  abstract = {This study examines the application of advanced data mining techniques associated with trace element concentrations for authenticity evaluation of organic coffee samples. Fifty-four coffee samples (20 organic and 34 nonorganic) were evaluated according to their macro and microelement contents to establish reference ranges and identify differences in patterns of chemical elements in both crop procedures. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of thirty-eight chemical elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Eu, Er, Gd, Ge, Ho, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sm, Sr, Yb, W, U, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, Tl, Zr and Zn). In general, higher levels of chemical elements were found in conventional coffee compared with organic samples. The classification of samples was performed by using three well known data mining algorithms, named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). When all analyzed variables were considered, a 96.3\% accuracy level was obtained with the three algorithms. The level of accuracy remained at 96.3\% for SVM and MLP and rose to 98.2 for NB when only eight of the investigated minerals – i.e. Zn, Se, Ba, U, Dy, Tl, Th, Mo – were used for chemometric analysis. This level of accuracy provides a strong foundation to propose the combination of trace element spectral fingerprints with data mining techniques as a valuable tool to evaluate the authenticity of organic coffee samples.},

The optimized method of tocopherols, tocotrienols, and PC-8 separation via SFC with UV detection was validated on a biphenyl core-shell column. The sample preparation conditions of the plant oils involved a simple dilution in 2-propanol (1:9, v/v), followed by direct injection into the SFC. For the analysis of 24 different plant oils we recommended the following final analytical scale SFC method conditions: 5 µL for the injection volume and sample oil:2-propanol dilution ratio of 1:9. The final assay developed facilitated the rapid ({$<$}15 min) and sensitive (limit of detection within the range of 2.5–7.4 μg/mL and the limit of quantitation within the range of 7.7–22.6 μg/mL) analyses of tocochromanols in obtained cold-pressed oils from twenty-four different plant species. Furthermore, the method was repeatable and repro­ ducible with \% RSD values in the context of standard retention times which ranged within 0.10–0.31 intraday and 0.59–0.79 interday.},

The results of multi-location peak parking demonstrated a consistent increase in peak variance from the 1 cm position of the column to the 9 cm location. This increase in band broadening supported the theory of a decreasing ligand density along the length of this gradient column. This is consistent with efficiency measurements performed in both the forward and reverse flow directions, with an improved efficiency (15\% increase in N m(-1)) in the reverse direction. These results are consistent with theoretical investigations into stationary phase gradients.},

Study of the distribution of publications over various chemistry research areas revealed that analytical chemistry and biochemistry are integrating AI to the greatest extent and with the highest growth rates. We also investigated trends in interdisciplinary research and identified frequently occurring combinations of research areas in publications. Furthermore, topic analyses were conducted for journal and patent publications to illustrate emerging associations of AI with certain chemistry research topics. Notable publications in various chemistry disciplines were then evaluated and presented to highlight emerging use cases. Finally, the occurrence of different classes of substances and their roles in AI-related chemistry research were quantified, further detailing the popularity of AI adoption in the life sciences and analytical chemistry. In summary, this Review offers a broad overview of how AI has progressed in various fields of chemistry and aims to provide an understanding of its future directions.},

The effect of temperature, pressure, additive identity, and concentration on retention are studied. Polar modifiers do not completely suppress tailing. The addition of a very polar additive, like trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), to a modified mobile phase improves peak shapes, apparently by covering active sites on the silica packing material. Additives sometimes continue to be retained and improve peak shapes even after removal from the mobile phase.},

  abstract = {The writer of this review published in 1978 a three-part article on two-dimensional gas chromatography in the first three issues of this journal [1]. The review was written at a time when capillary column GC was still in its infancy. Commercial columns were (essentially) unavailable and sample introduction into capillary columns was done exclusively in the split mode. Two-dimensional separations were explored in only a few laboratories. The limitations of capillary column technology made this exercise rather difficult. The introduction of fused silica capillary columns in the early eighties drastically changed the landscape in which gas chromatography was practiced. It took the chromatographic community just a few years to convert from packed columns to capillary columns. Instrumentation and accessories specifically designed for capillary column use came onto the market. This writer had great hopes that the revolution in capillary column GC would be mirrored in the development of instrumentation for Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. This never materialized. On the contrary, tentative steps taken by a few manufacturers and suppliers of chromatographic equipment fizzled out. It was perhaps the introduction of relatively inexpensive and user friendly GC/MS instrumentation, in combination with nearly indestructible fused silica capillary columns that took away the incentive to develop commercially viable Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. Much of the thinking went like this: why insist on good chromatography if mass spectrometry can do the job without the need for complete separation. Some progress in the further development of conventional Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography has certainly been made over the last 20 years but there has not been a great deal of excitement. Applications have also been relatively sparse and they are limited to just a few areas. Science does not remain static and chromatography is no exception. Progress in gas chromatography is driven by new technology and ideas. Substantial improvements in two-dimensional GC were not forthcoming until Phillips and his research group introduced and implemented an entirely new form of Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography, called comprehensive two-dimensional GC, or GC×GC. This breakthrough occurred only in 1991 [2]. It does take some time before scientists change attitudes and habits. There is always a time lag between the introduction of new technology and its general acceptance. The public's attitude toward comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography is probably no exception. The number of scientists who are actively pursuing this new branch of gas chromatography is still very small. It is often a single individual who carries the torch. J.B. Phillips' name is synonymous with comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. He is not only its inventor and proponent but his fertile mind has initiated research in other related areas. Sadly, he passed away shortly before this review was written. This contribution is dedicated to his memory.},

  abstract = {The coffee is an important commodity to Brazil. Species, climate, genotypes, cultivation practices and industrialization are critical to final quality of the beverage. Thus, the development of analytical methods for coffee authentication is important to ensure the origin of the bean. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology for geographical classification of different genotypes of arabica coffee using infrared spectroscopy and support vector machines (SVM). The spectra were collected in the range of near infrared (NIRS) and mid infrared (FTIR). For the data analysis, a SVM was built using radial basis as kernel function and the one-versus-all multiclass approach. The C and g parameters of SVM were optimized using the genetic algorithm. With the application of the NIRS-SVM approach all test samples were correctly classified with a sensitivity and specificity of 100\%, while FTIR-SVM had a slightly lower performance. Therefore, it was possible to confirm that infrared spectroscopy is a fast and effective method for geographic certification with little sample preparation, and without the production of chemical wastes. Furthermore, the SVM can be a chemometric alternative in tandem with infrared spectroscopy for another classification problems.},

Dynamic time warping was originally developed as a method for spoken word recognition, but shows potential in the objective analysis of time variant signals, such as manufacturing data. In this work we will discuss the application of dynamic time warping with a derivative weighting function to align chromatograms to facilitate process monitoring and fault detection. In addition, we will demonstrate the utility of this method as a preprocessing step for multivariate model development.},

In recent years, rapid and reliable sensor, spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques have emerged that, together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics, have improved the whole control process by reducing the time of analysis and providing more informative results. In this progression of more and better information, the combination (fusion) of outputs of different instrumental techniques has emerged as a means for increasing the reliability of classification or prediction of foodstuff specifications as compared to using a single analytical technique. Although promising results have been obtained in food and beverage authentication and quality assessment, the combination of data from several techniques is not straightforward and represents an important challenge for chemometricians. This review provides a general overview of data fusion strategies that have been used in the field of food and beverage authentication and quality assessment.},

  abstract = {This paper explains the multi-way decomposition method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.},

Method: The literature was surveyed manually and electronically from 1820 to 2018. Results: A flow diagram has been developed to summarize the best approaches to deal with the authentication of coffee. Conclusions: Encouragement is given to the interlaboratory validation of spectroscopic approaches, the exploration of civet cat deoxyribonucleic acid for the identification of Kopi Luwak, and the development of appropriately large and well-curated datasets of authenticity information across multiple techniques. Highlights: The current analytical difficulties in the authentication of coffee are highlighted and suggestions made to improve the situation.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Speed of analysis is a significant limitation to current high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) and ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/MS systems. The flow rate limitations of MS detection require a compromise in the chromatographic flow rate, which in turn reduces throughput, and when using modern columns, a reduction in separation efficiency. Commonly, this restriction is combated through the post-column splitting of flow prior to entry into the mass spectrometer. However, this results in a loss of sensitivity and a loss in efficiency due to the post-extra column dead volume. METHODS: A new chromatographic column format known as 'parallel segmented flow' involves the splitting of eluent flow within the column outlet end fitting, and in this study we present its application on a HPLC electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Using parallel segmented flow, column flow rates as high as 2.5 mL/min were employed in the analysis of amino acids without post-column splitting to the mass spectrometer. Furthermore, when parallel segmented flow chromatography columns were employed, the sensitivity was more than twice that of conventional systems with post-column splitting when the same volume of mobile phase was passed through the detector. CONCLUSIONS: These finding suggest that this type of column technology will particularly enhance the capabilities of modern LC/MS enabling both high-throughput and sensitive mass spectral detection.

Each region of flow is able to be processed independently, such that post column detection emulates end column localised detection. As a result of this flow segmentation and the subsequent more efficient means of detection, column efficiency was observed to increase by more than 20\%, with gains in sensitivity by as much as 22\%, and a decrease in peak volume by up to 85\%.

The process described herein illustrates how the principles of the infinite diameter column can be applied using conventional injection devices suitable for long-term analysis that requires robust protocols. Using this approach, sensitivity in separation was 2.5 times greater than conventional chromatography, yielding a product at twice the concentration. Benefits of curtain flow injection are thus relevant to both preparative-scale and analytical-scale separations.},

The parallel segmented outlet flow mode of operation offers advantages in terms of solvent consumption, waste generation, total analysis time and solute band volume when applying multiple detectors to HPLC, but the manner in which each detection system is influenced by changes in solute concentration and solution flow rates must be carefully considered.

  abstract = {The detrimental effect of heterogeneity on the efficiency of particle packed columns has been a long standing issue in chromatographic separations. This heterogeneity arises from the difference in packing density between the wall and central regions of the chromatographic bed and imparts radial variance in mobile phase velocity through the column. In conjunction with the uneven distribution of the sample band through frits and distributors at the head of the column, the resultant effect is a decrease in efficiency due to the formation of a parabolic-like sample band. We introduce the concept of Active Flow Management to counteract the effects of column heterogeneity via the separation of the flow eluting from the center of the column from that of the flow eluting near the peripheral wall region. The flow streams from the two aforementioned regions are separated by the use of a specialized column outlet fitting. By varying the ratio of flow eluting from the center to the peripheral region it was possible to increase the efficiency of a 100x21mm column by up to 57\% compared to a column operated in the conventional manner.},

  abstract = {Active flow technology is a new high performance liquid chromatography column format that has been shown to improve separation performance in terms of the sensitivity, resolution and number of theoretical plates. In this study active flow technology has been shown as a platform for multiplexed detection, with sample analysis being undertaken from each of four separated flow streams located at the column outlet: One central port and three peripheral ports. The flow homogeneity across each of these ports was studied using theoretical plates and sensitivity as the performance indicators. The experimental findings showed that the theoretical plates were lower for solutes that eluted from the peripheral ports compared to the performance observed from a conventional column. However, the sensitivity in UV detection that was obtained from any of the three peripheral ports was approximately the same as that from a conventional column. The study therefore concluded that detection from the peripheral ports was feasible, dependent on the attributes of the detector itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Wine is a popular alcoholic beverage that has been consumed for hundreds of years. Benefits from moderate alcohol consumption have been widely supported by the scientific literature and, in this line, red wine intake has been related to a lesser risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Experimental studies and meta-analyses have mainly attributed this outcome to the presence in red wine of a great variety of polyphenolic compounds such as resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, and anthocyanin. Resveratrol is considered the most effective wine compound with respect to the prevention of CHD because of its antioxidant properties. The mechanisms responsible for its putative cardioprotective effects would include changes in lipid profiles, reduction of insulin resistance, and decrease in oxidative stress of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of this review is to summarize the accumulated evidence correlating moderate red wine consumption with prevention of CHD by focusing on the different mechanisms underlying this relationship. Furthermore, the chemistry of wine as well as chemical factors that influence the composition of the bioactive components of red wine are also discussed.},

The brewing process was carried out at two extraction temperatures (10 ± 0.5°C and 25 ± 0.5°C) and two particle sizes: medium (MG, 0.70–1.70 mm) and fine (FG, 0.43–0.71 mm). CBC brewing showed a complex relationship between brewing temperature and coffee grind particle size. The increase in brewing temperature enhanced the extraction rate. However, the particle size conditioned the extraction equilibrium time and final CBC properties. MG accelerated the brewing extrac­ tion rates to reach equilibrium in CBC properties (\textasciitilde 7 h for 25ºC and \textasciitilde 12 h for 10ºC), while FG induced slower extraction rates and prolonged extraction times (above 12 h for both temperatures). However, FG produced CBC with higher bioactive compound con­ tent, darker color, and slightly less acidity than MG.},

Their interface is unstable and a complex fingering pattern may arise. This phenomenon is important in chromatography because it may lead to a decrease or even a failure in separations. The onset of viscous fingering was visually observed by packing a glass column with particles having the same refractive index as the mobile phase and injecting plugs of dye solutions having viscosities different from that of the mobile phase. Severe fingering effects are observed if the viscosity difference exceeds 0.17 cP. However, for smaller viscosity differences, band distortions are observed that may affect retention data, band efficiency, and band resolution. Careful attention should be paid to matching the mobile phase viscosity and that of the injection plug when accurate chromatographic information is required. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds are important quality components in red wine affecting the taste of bitterness and astringency, the color and long wine stability and aging. In this study, a rapid and sensitive analytical technique was used for detailed phenolics fingerprinting of 42 Macedonian red wines produced from different wine regions. Analyses were performed using high performance liquid chromatography in combination with low-field drift tube ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC×IMS-TOFMS). The reliability of DTCCSN2 values, based on consensus values from a standardized and reproducible workflow, was evaluated as an identification point for wine metabolomics. Using appropriate software tools for alignment and statistical evaluation, a full dataset for each wine was obtained, including retention time, accurate mass, fragment spectra and DTCCSN2. Putative compounds were further assessed by assignment of in-source and post-drift mass fragments aligned according to retention time, drift time, and accurate mass. Up to seven identification points for a single compound can be generated when data from both positive and negative mode measurements are combined. The correlation between abundance across the two ionization modes was found to be very good in many examples with correlation coefficients (R2) values of 0.63-0.97 for eleven putative metabolites in Vranec wines, and 0.70-0.99 for nine putative metabolites in Pinot Noir.

  abstract = {A novel on-line HPLC-cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) method was developed for the selective determination of polyphenols (flavonoids, simple phenolic and hydroxycinnamic acids) in complex plant matrices. The method combines chromatographic separation, constituent analysis, and post-column identification of antioxidants in plant extracts. The separation of polyphenols was performed on a C18 column using gradient elution with two different mobile phase solutions, i.e., MeOH and 0.2\% o-phosphoric acid. The HPLC-separated antioxidant polyphenols in the extracts react with copper(II)neocuproine (Cu(II)-Nc) reagent in a post-column reaction coil to form a derivative. The reagent is reduced by antioxidants to the copper(I)-neocuproine (Cu(I)-Nc) chelate having maximum absorption at 450 nm. The negative peaks of antioxidant constituents were monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance due to Cu(I)-Nc. The detection limits of polyphenols at 450 nm (in the range of 0.17–3.46 ␮M) after post-column derivatization were comparable to those at 280 nm UV detection without derivatization. The developed method was successfully applied to the identification of antioxidant compounds in crude extracts of Camellia sinensis, Origanum marjorana and Mentha. The method is rapid, inexpensive, versatile, non-laborious, uses stable reagents, and enables the on-line qualitative and quantitative estimation of antioxidant constituents of complex plant samples.},

Technological advancements in sample preparation and mechanical automation have allowed HPLC to become a high-throughput tool which poses new challenges for reproducible and rapid analysis of the resulting chromatograms. Here we present hplc-py, a Python package that permits rapid and reliable quantitation of component signals within a chromatogram for pipelined workflows. This is achieved by a signal detection and quantitation algorithm which i) identifies windows of time which contain peaks and ii) infers the parameters of a mixture of amplitude-weighted skew-normal distributions which sum to reconstruct the observed signal. This approach is particularly effective at deconvolving highly overlapping signals, allowing for precise absolute quantitation of chemical constituents with similar chromatographic retention times.},

Four separation techniques based on molecular characteristics and interaction type use mechanisms of ion exchange, surface adsorption, partition, and size exclusion. Other chromatography techniques are based on the stationary bed, including column, thin layer, and paper chromatography. Column chromatography is one of the most common methods of protein purification.},

  abstract = {Many studies have reported the use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to characterize wines or to predict wine chemical composition. However, little is known about the effect of variation in temperature on the NIR spectrum of wine and the subsequent effect on the performance of calibrations used to measure chemical composition. Several parameters influence the spectra of organic molecules in the NIR region, with temperature being one of the most important factors affecting the vibration intensity and frequency of molecular bonds. Wine is a complex mixture of chemical components (e.g. water, sugars, organic acids, and ethanol), and a simple ethanol and water model solution cannot be used to study the possible effects of temperature variations in the NIR spectrum of wine. Ten red and 10 white wines were scanned in triplicate at six different temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 45 degrees C and 50 degrees C) in the visible (vis) and NIR regions (400-2500 nm) in a monochromator instrument in transmission mode (1 mm path length). Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression models were developed using full cross validation (leave-one-out). These models were used to interpret the spectra and to develop calibrations for alcohol, sugars (glucose+fructose) and pH at different temperatures. The results showed that differences in the spectra around 970 nm and 1400 nm, related to O-H bonding were observed for both varieties. Additionally an effect of temperature on the vis region of red wine spectra was observed. The standard error of cross validation (SECV) achieved for the PLS calibration models tended to inverse as the temperature increased. The practical implication of this study it is recommended that the temperature of scanning for wine analysis using a 1 mm path length cuvette should be between 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C.},

  abstract = {There is a large amount of literature relating to multivariate analytical methods using liquid chromatography together with multivariate chemometric/data mining methods in the food science field. Nevertheless, dating the obtained results cannot be compared as they are based on data acquired by a particular analytical instrument, thus they are instrument-dependant. Therefore, this creates difficulties in generating a database large enough to gather together all the variability of the samples. The solution to this problem is to obtain an instrument-agnostic chromatographic signal that is independent of the chromatographic state, i.e., measuring instrument or particular condition of the same instrument from which it was acquired. This paper describes the methodology to be followed to obtain standardized instrumental fingerprints when liquid chromatography is used for prior separation. For this purpose both internal and external chemical standards series are used as references. As an application example, we have applied this methodology for the determination of biophenols in olive oil by liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet-visible detector (LC-UV), using three different LC-UV instruments. The instrument-agnostic fingerprints obtained show a high grade of similarity, regardless of the state of the chromatographic system or the time of acquisition.},

  abstract = {Fingerprinting methods describe a variety of analytical methods that provide analytical signals related to the composition of foodstuffs in a non-selective way such as by collecting a spectrum or a chromatogram. Mathematical processing of the information in such fingerprints may allow the characterisation and/or authentication of foodstuffs. In this context, the particular meaning of 'fingerprinting', in conjunction with 'profiling', is different from the original meanings used in metabolomics. This fact has produced some confusion with the use of these terms in analytical papers. Researchers coming from the metabolomic field could use 'profiling' or 'fingerprinting' on a different way to researchers who are devoted to food science. The arrival of an eclectic discipline, named 'foodomics' has not been enough to allay this terminological problem, since the authors keep on using the terms with both meanings. Thus, a first goal of this tutorial is to clarify the difference between both terms. In addition, the chemical approaches for food authentication, i.e., chemical markers, component profiling and instrumental fingerprinting, have been described. A new term, designated as 'food identitation', has been introduced in order to complete the life cycle of the chemical-based food authentication process. Chromatographic fingerprinting has been explained in detail and some strategies which could be applied has been clarified and discussed. Particularly, the strategies for chromatographic signals acquisition and chromatographic data handling are unified in a single framework. Finally, an overview about the applications of chromatographic (GC and LC) fingerprints in food authentication using different chemometric techniques has been included.},

  abstract = {A simple approach is proposed for the classification of Cabernet Sauvignon wines from two different countries in South America (Brazil and Chile). The strategy combines the wines’ functionality, designed as antioxidant activity (DPPH and ORAC), total polyphenols (TP), total anthocyanins (TA), and color, with a data mining technique known as support vector machines (SVM). The original dataset has 16 wine samples from Brazil and 113 from Chile. Algorithms were used to balance the dataset. Using resampling algorithms, we extended the Brazilian wines to 32 samples and reduced the Chilean wines to 32. With the proposed methodology, it was possible to classify the origin of the wine with an accuracy of 89\% when using the 20 original elements. An accuracy of 83\% was found using only 5 elements (L, DPPH, delph-3-acetylglu, peon-3-(coum)glu, and pet-3-acetylglu). Our methodology can be used for origin certification of other wines.},

  abstract = {Power transformations are commonly used in image processing techniques to manipulate image contrast. Many analytical results, including chromatograms, are essentially presented as images, often to convey qualitative information. Power transformations have remarkable effects on the appearance of the image, in chromatography, for example, increasing apparent resolution between peaks by the factor root n and apparent column efficiency (plate counts) by a factor of n for an nth-power transform. The profile of a Gaussian peak is not qualitatively changed, but the peak becomes narrower, whereas for an exponentially tailing peak, asymmetry at the 10\% peak height level changes markedly. Using several examples we show that power transforms also increase signal-to-noise ratio and make it easier to discern an event of detection. However, they may not improve the limit of detection. Power responses are intrinsic to some detection schemes, and in others they are imbedded in instrument firmware to increase apparent linear range that the casual user may not be aware of. The consequences are demonstrated and discussed.},

Students then evaluate the electrode response as a function of specific-ion activity, measure the activity of an unknown-concentration solution, and determine the electrode selectivity by repeating the analysis in the presence of a fixed amount of interfering ion. With a choice of chloride, nitrate, acetate, and sulfate specific-ion electrodes and a variety of interfering ions, each student in a lab section can do a different experiment while keeping both the lab cost for consumables and the setup time low. The obtained selectivity values are in agreement with the Hofmeister series. Students practice analytical laboratory skills by designing and preparing a calibration curve, see benefits and limitations of ion-selective electrodes, and make use of the Nernst equation.},

  abstract = {The statistical model of overlap is modified to address one-dimensional separations containing single-component peaks (SCPs) with variable Poisson densities. The resulting theory describes overlap in unsaturated separations, for which the variation of SCP density throughout the separation is known. The expected number of peaks is expressed by an integral, whose value depends on the average saturation of the separation, the number of detectable components, and a frequently function proportional to the SCP density. The theory is verified by its application to computer-simulated chromatograms containing SCPs with linear, quadratic, sinusoidal, and exponential frequencies. Procedures are proposed to estimate the frequency function from the distribution of chromatographic maxima and to estimate the number of detectable components in chromatograms. These procedures are verified by their application to computer-simulated chromatograms and to an experimental chromatogram of a well-characterized mixture. Computer simulations show that these procedures are more robust than those based on a constant Poisson density. A mathematical proof is offered, which shows that at constant low average saturation the maximum number of peaks in a separation containing SCPs with variable Poisson densities is obtained, when the SCP density is constant. This proof may explain previous experimental observations.},

  abstract = {In terms of large use of plastic products, a necessity exists to minimize effects of the waste produced on environment by recycling, reuse and application in new products. In Brazil, the espresso coffee capsules are an emerging plastic waste, representing 0.9\% of the coffee consumed in 2017. Therefore, Nescafé Dolce Gusto espresso coffee capsules were chosen in order to understand the polypropylene stabilization and degradation initiators with the purpose of recycling by applying in a composite material, as home composting product. In this context, the plastic capsule wastes were exposed to chemical, thermal, accelerated weathering (ultraviolet radiation\,+\,humidity) and natural weathering in order to analyze the influence of exposure and possibilities of a real application in a composting environment. Masses of the samples were monitored before and during the weathering conditions. Thermal (TGA and DSC) and chemical (FTIR) analysis were carried out before and after exposure. No changes in thermal stability were observed, however, samples conditioned in acid solution presented thermal degradation event beginning at 131\,°C. In addition, all samples presented a similar behavior of melting and crystallization points, which did not change with exposure. FTIR analysis showed a disappearance of CC and CO bonds on samples exposed to natural weathering and basic solution conditioning. It also showed formation of chromophores groups on samples exposed to accelerated weathering. The visual analysis showed huge differences in samples exposed to accelerated weathering and acid solution, which were the most damaged. On the other hand, samples exposed to natural weathering, thermal and basic conditioning did not presented significantly changes supported by the TGA and FTIR results.},

  abstract = {Purpose Coffee is among the most appreciated beverages in the world, and there is a wide variety of methods of coffee consumption, inside and outside the home, with a significant growth in the coffee machine market for single serve. Due to this significant growth and in agreement with the current sustainability directives, the objective of the present article was to evaluate the environmental performance of the preparation step of the most representative methods of beverage preparation. Methods The principles of the life cycle assessment (LCA) were applied to evaluate the environmental efficiency of the beverage preparation stage for the following methods: the traditional espresso, the French Press, the AeroPress, filtered coffee systems in coffee shops, the homemade filtration, and single-serve automatic machines. The boundaries of the study included the agricultural stage, the industrial roasting/grinding, and the beverage preparation up to final disposal of waste. Data were collected from 40 establishments among coffee shops, bakeries, and homes, with 153 individual data. The environmental efficiency was measured regarding energy, water consumption, waste generation, and the environmental impacts scores related to global warming, eutrophication, acidification, abiotic depletion, and human toxicity calculated by CML 2001 method. Results and discussion Individualized data of coffee roasting/grinding from the industrial process was provided. The preparation of a single-serve soft pod (paper sachet) using an automatic machine resulted in the lowest emission of 14.3 g of CO2 eq/50 mL of beverage in the monodose category, and also a non-biodegradable packaging waste to landfills about 11 times less than the singleserve plastic capsules with aluminum top seal, which had the highest consumption of energy, water, and waste generation in the single-serve category. In the category of consumption outside the home, espresso coffee, produced under pressure and higher temperatures, had the greatest impact, mainly due to its concentration, and the energy demanded by the automatic machines. Conclusions The study identified that the concentration of coffee, as well as the ratio of packaging mass per volume of beverage prepared, has a significant effect on the calculated environmental impacts. The single-serve pods method using paper sachets can associate convenience with low environmental impact. The results obtained allow the consumer to include the environmental aspects in the choice of method for beverage preparation and also provide relevant information for public policy concerning residue generation.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for research chemists and biochemists to have a basic familiarity with computer programming. Adding programming content to already crowded STEM undergraduate curricula, however, can be challenging. When programming content is introduced within the chemistry curriculum, it is most often incorporated into upper division courses, but students could benefit from earlier exposure. Here, we describe incorporating Python programming, using Jupyter notebooks, into a lower division analytical chemistry course in support of the existing learning outcomes of the course. By linking lab experiments with specific course learning outcomes, quantitative topics, and computer programming concepts, we have created a series of analytical chemistry lab modules that introduce students to Python coding without losing any of the traditional content of the course. Additionally, we show that this curriculum can be successfully implemented by faculty with limited coding experience. Assessment indicates that the Python-enhanced course makes students more positive about the applicability of quantitative skills in many areas, and increases their self-perception of their level of preparation for future careers.},

Because students’ learning goals are linked to achievement and dependent on context, research on students’ goals in the laboratory context may lead to better understanding about the efficacy of lab curricula. This study characterized undergraduate students’ learning goals for general chemistry laboratory coursework by recording video of students completing laboratory experiments and interviewing the students about their experiences. The data was analyzed utilizing the framework of learning domains as described by Human Constructivism. Students were found to be primarily guided by affective goals, such as the desire to feel good by completing the requirements and getting done early. This stood in conflict with any psychomotor or cognitive goals they held concurrently. The data provide suggestions for reform of the general chemistry laboratory curriculum.},

Color coordinates allow researchers to universalize and standardize their color measurements, and nowadays, determining the color coordinates of samples is a routine method applied by organic and analytical chemists, students, and specialists like enologists. Although the colorimetry method requires a simple experimental procedure, many students, researchers and teachers might find the mathematical treatment of the data too difficult. In this paper, we introduce two workbooks using Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Visual Basic that simplify the use of colorimetry: one of these workbooks is specifically oriented to students and teachers, and it includes explanations and information about each color model. The second workbook is aimed at researchers, and it allows them to introduce and analyze numerous samples at the same time. Finally, another workbook has been included that contains various sample spectra that teachers can use to improve student comprehension of color coordinates.},

Various statistical parameters characteristic of both the mixture and the chromatographic process, including the expected number of detectable mixture components and the expected numbers of singlet and multiplet chromatographic peaks, were theoretically estimated from several dozen chromatograms of this mixture by using two procedures. These theoretical parameters were then compared to their experimental counterparts, which were known for the synthetic mixture. Excellent agreement between experiment and theory was found at low chromatographic saturations. This agreement affirms earlier predictions based on this model and supports the argument that peak overlap can be addressed in some instances by theoretical means. At higher saturations, systematic departures of experiment from theory were found. In particular, the experimental numbers of singlet and multiplet peaks are smaller and larger, respectively, than those predicted, when the peak capacity is less than roughly twice the number of components.},

Metabolomics aims at the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of wide arrays of metabolites in biological samples. These numerous analytes have very diverse physico-chemical properties and occur at different abundance levels. Consequently, comprehensive metabolomics investigations are primarily a challenge for analytical chemistry and specifically mass spectrometry has vast potential as a tool for this type of investigation. Metabolomics require special approaches for sample preparation, separation, and mass spectrometric analysis. Current examples of those approaches are described in this review. It primarily focuses on metabolic fingerprinting, a technique that analyzes all detectable analytes in a given sample with subsequent classification of samples and identification of differentially expressed metabolites, which define the sample classes. To perform this complex task, data analysis tools, metabolite libraries, and databases are required. Therefore, recent advances in metabolomics bioinformatics are also discussed.

  abstract = {The ‘‘antioxidant power” of a food is an expression of its capability both to defend the human organism from the action of the free radicals and to prevent degenerative disorders deriving from persistent oxidative stress. Purpose of this study is to analyse the antioxidant capacity (measured by means of the crocin bleaching method) of several samples of Sicilian red wines and to evaluate their dependency on the vintage and on the grape variety. Finally, the correlation between the single flavonoids compounds and the antioxidant capacity has been investigated. The analyses show that the antioxidant properties of red wine appear to be unequally influenced by the vintages for the different cultivars and that the correlation between antioxidant capacity and the total phenolic contents is weak. The latter can be explained by the fact that the wine’s antioxidant properties are influenced differently by each polyphenolic molecule. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Theoretical calculations at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level were used for the evaluation of five reaction descriptors (thermodynamic quantities) – BDE, IP, PA, PDE and ETE. Those values are related to three possible antioxidant mechanisms: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), single-electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT), and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) mechanisms. PCM implicit solvation model was used to simulate water environment for four coffee components - 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, cafestol and quinine. Both acids were the most potent antioxidants with similar activity for both mechanisms probable in water (SET-PT and SPLET), SPLET being the energetically favored one. Cafestol and quinine have weaker activity considering their aliphatic hydroxyl groups.},

However, current approaches for retention time prediction lack sufficient accuracy due to limited available experimental data. Here we introduce the METLIN small molecule retention time (SMRT) dataset, an experimentally acquired reverse-phase chromatography retention time dataset covering up to 80,038 small molecules. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70\textbackslash (\textbackslash\%\textbackslash ) of the cases, the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the community to apply machine learning or first principles strategies to generate better models for retention time prediction.},

The current study aimed at investigating the antioxidant activity, in relation to the phytochemical composition, of authenticated Brazilian green and roasted Coffea arabica and C. robusta, along with 15 commercial specimens collected from the Middle East. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI–HRMS) and UV spectrometry were employed for profiling and fingerprinting, respectively. With the aid of global natural product social molecular networking (GNPS), a total of 88 peaks were annotated as belonging to different chemical classes, of which 11 metabolites are reported for the first time in coffee seeds. Moreover, chemometric tools showed comparable results between both platforms, with more advantages for UV in the annotation of roasting products, suggesting that UV can serve as a discriminative tool. Additionally, antioxidant assays coupled with the UHPLC-ESI–HRMS dataset using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated that caffeoylquinic acid and caffeine were potential antioxidant markers in unroasted coffee versus dicaffeoyl quinolactone and melanoidins in roasted coffee. The study presents a multiplex metabolomics approach to the quality control of coffee, one of the most consumed beverages.},

Meanwhile, interest in the pathophysiological mechanism elucidation and pharmaceutical applications requires measurement of vitamin D metabolites and analogues. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been increasingly utilized in these applications. In this work, our objective was to critically review the progress of LC-MS application in measuring vitamin D metabolites and analogues in biological fluids. Methods The LC-MS methods included were selected from those searchable in PubMed up to January 2010. Results and Conclusion LC-MS has unique advantages in measuring various vitamin D metabolites and analogues due to its flexibility, sensitivity, and specificity. Despite some controversies over serum 25(OH)D tests, LC-MS will be used for standardizing serum 25(OH)D assays using reference materials available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.},

It is suspected the reasons for these effects are solvent strength mismatch and/or viscosity mismatch. This study presents a systematic and fundamental investigation of the origin of these peak deformations due to the injection solvent effects in SFC, using both systematic experiments and numerical modeling. The first set of experiments proved that the injection volume and the elution strength of the sample solution had a major impact of the shapes of the eluted peaks. Secondly, the sample band elution profile was numerically modeled on a theoretical basis assuming both un-retained and retained co-solvent injection plugs, respectively. These calculations quantitatively confirmed our first set of experiments but also pointed out that there is also an additional significant effect. Third, viscous fingering experiments were performed using viscosity contrast conditions imitating those encountered in SFC. These experiments clearly proved that viscous fingering effects play a significant role. A new method for determination of adsorption isotherms of solvents was also developed, called the "Retention Time Peak Method" (RTPM). The RTPM was used for fast estimation of the adsorption isotherms of the modifier and required using only two experiments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

The focus is directed towards the chemometric processing of multi-way data arrays in which one or more instrumental modes describe the elution time behavior across liquid or gas chromatographic columns, and the remaining ones are of spectroscopic nature, e.g. UV-vis absorption, fluorescence emission (either as vectors or matrices) or mass spectrometry. Successful multi-way data decomposition into profiles for the contributing components allows one to perform quantitative analysis of complex samples. Quantitative applications usually make appropriate use of the second-order advantage which is inherent to multi-way data processing, and reduce the complexity of the data to a virtual univariate calibration which is typical of classical analytical chemistry. A number of recent experimental works will be discussed to illustrate the above concepts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With globalization and complex distribution systems, adulteration may have a far-reaching impact and even adverse consequences on well-being. The means of the international community to confront and solve food fraud today are scattered and largely ineffective. A collective approach is needed to identify all stakeholders in the food supply chain, certify and qualify them, exclude those failing to meet applicable standards, and track food in a real time. This review provides some background into the drivers of fraudulent practices (economically motivated adulteration, food-industry perspectives, and consumers’ perceptions of fraud) and discusses a wide range of the currently available technologies for detecting food adulteration followed by multivariate pattern recognition tools. Food chain integrity policies are discussed. Future directions in research, concerned not only with food adulterers but also with food safety and climate change, may be useful for researchers in developing interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary problems.},

  abstract = {A thorough study was done to test the reactivity of the Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) reagent towards various compound classes. Over 80 compounds were tested. Compound classes included phenols, thiols, vitamins, amino acids, proteins, nucleotide bases, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, inorganic ions, metal complexes, aldehydes and ketones. All phenols, proteins and thiols tested were reactive towards the reagent. Many vitamin derivatives were also reactive, as were the inorganic ions Fe+2, Mn+2, I− and SO3−2. Other compounds showing reactivity included the nucleotide base guanine and the trioses glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone. Copper complexation enhanced the reactivity of salicylate derivatives towards the reagent while zinc complexation did not. Several amino acids and sugars which were reported to be reactive towards the F-C reagent in earlier studies were found not to be reactive in our study, at least in the concentrations used., Reaction kinetics of each compound with the F-C reagent were also measured. Most compounds tested showed a biphasic kinetic pattern with half lives under one minute. Trolox and ascorbic acid displayed a rapid monophasic pattern in which the reaction reached endpoint within one minute., In summary, our study has shown that the F-C reagent is significantly reactive towards other compounds besides phenols. As other investigators have suggested, the F-C assay should be seen as a measure of total antioxidant capacity rather than phenolic content. Since phenolics are the most abundant antioxidants in most plants, it gives a rough approximation of total phenolic content in most cases.},

  abstract = {We studied the VOCs profile of three red wine varieties, produced in the Valley of Tulum (San Juan-Argentina), over 4 consecutive years. Our main goal was to verify if different wine varieties could be differentiated from their VOCs profile, considering changes induced by their age, the yeast inoculated and the type of alcoholic fermentation, establishing those compounds that could be used as chemical markers of a particular variety. Stepwise LDA of selected VOCs allowed 100\% differentiation between studied wines, showing that high levels of 1-hexanol were characteristic for Malbec, while low level of ethyl caproate was characteristic for Bonarda. Using controlled fermentations, 1-hexanol, a pre-fermentative VOC, presented a similar trend in wines produced from different yeast; while other fermentative VOCs, like ethyl caproate and ethyl caprilate, presented lower levels for Bonarda but also for Syrah. To our knowledge, this is the first report on characterization of VOCs from Bonarda. Additionally, the quantitative analysis of VOCs profile, coupled to chemometrics, present a good alternative to differentiate wines from different varieties and also for studying wine fermentation.

  abstract = {Coffee production has long been culturally and economically important in Puerto Rico. However, since peaking in the late nineteenth century, harvests are near record lows with many former farms abandoned. While value-added markets present new opportunities to reinvigorate the industry, regional trends associated with climate change may threaten the ability to produce high-quality coffee. Here, we discuss the history of coffee in Puerto Rico, outline important bioclimatic parameters, and model current and future habitat suitability using statistically downscaled climate data. Model projections suggest that warming trends may surpass important temperature thresholds during the coming decades. Under high (A2) and mid-low (A1B) emission scenarios for 2011–2040, Puerto Rico is projected to exceed mean annual temperature parameters for growth of Coffea arabica. Warming and drying trends may accelerate after 2040 and could result in top producing municipalities losing 60–84\% of highly suitable growing conditions by 2070. Under the A2 scenario, Puerto Rico may only retain 24~km2 of highly suitable conditions by 2071–2099. High temperatures and low precipitation levels can result in diminished quality and yields, as well as increased exposure and sensitivity to certain insects and diseases. The climate data and models used are based on best current understanding of climate and emission interactions with results best interpreted as projected climate trends rather than predictions of future weather. Planning, innovation, and adaptation provide promising avenues to address current and future socioecological challenges while building a model of sustainable and resilient coffee production in Puerto Rico and throughout the region.},

  abstract = {Since its first isolation in 1934, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been studied across a variety of research areas. This unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid is almost ubiquitous in humans and in other vertebrates. HA is involved in many key processes, including cell signaling, wound reparation, tissue regeneration, morphogenesis, matrix organization and pathobiology, and has unique physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesivity, hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity. For these reasons, exogenous HA has been investigated as a drug delivery system and treatment in cancer, ophthalmology, arthrology, pneumology, rhinology, urology, aesthetic medicine and cosmetics. To improve and customize its properties and applications, HA can be subjected to chemical modifications: conjugation and crosslinking. The present review gives an overview regarding HA, describing its history, physico-chemical, structural and hydrodynamic properties and biology (occurrence, biosynthesis (by hyaluronan synthases), degradation (by hyaluronidases and oxidative stress), roles, mechanisms of action and receptors). Furthermore, both conventional and recently emerging methods developed for the industrial production of HA and its chemical derivatization are presented. Finally, the medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications of HA and its derivatives are reviewed, reporting examples of HA-based products that currently are on the market or are undergoing further investigations.},

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites generally involved in plant adaptation to environmental stress conditions. Chlorogenic acids (CGA) and related compounds are the main components of the phenolic fraction of green coffee beans, reaching levels up to 14 \% (dry matter basis). These compounds have a number of beneficial health properties related to their potent antioxidant activity as well as hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic and antiviral activities. The main groups of CGA found in green coffee beans include caffeoylquinic acids, dicaffeoylquinic acids, feruloylquinic acids, p-coumaroylquinic acids and mixed diesters of caffeic and ferulic acids with quinic acid, each group with at least three isomers. During coffee processing, CGA may be isomerized, hydrolyzed or degraded into low molecular weight compounds. The high temperatures of roasting also produce transformation of part of CGA into quinolactones and, along with other compounds, melanoidins. This review focuses on the chemical characteristics, biosynthesis, and distribution of CGA and related compounds in coffee. The influence of genetic, physiological and environmental factors as well as processing on the chemical composition of coffee beans is discussed. The impact of CGA composition of green coffee on cup quality is also approached. Despite the existence of substantial published information on the total levels of CGA in coffee, more research is needed on the composition of minor phenolic compounds and specific CGA isomers (and related substances) in green and roasted coffee beans, as well as their impact on coffee quality.},

  abstract = {The Griess assay is widely used by regulation agencies as an official method for nitrite quantification in water and food samples. In Brazil, the official method, which has been used to determine nitrite in food, was described by Instituto Adolfo Lutz (283/IV) in 1984. It uses 8 mL of reactants and provides 50 mL (reactants plus sample) of waste per sample analyzed. Here, students scaled down the official method 50 times and quantified nitrite in water and food samples by using just 0.2 mL of the Griess reactant and 1 mL of sample. Quantitative analysis was carried out using absorbance measured at 540 nm (standard method) and 96well-plate images (proposed method) obtained with a desktop scanner. The nitrite was extracted from solid food samples by heating it in a water bath. After heating, sample color and turbidity were eliminated by addition of K4[Fe(CN)6] and ZnSO4 solutions and filtering. During samples preparation, students evaluate the heating time effect in nitrite extraction from sausage samples using hypothesis tests. Students did a series of matrix matched samples to observe the matrix effect. Students also calculated the detection limit (DL) and the quantification limit (QL) for the proposed method (1.35 and 4.1 μmol/L nitrite, respectively) and for the standard method (1.1 and 3.4 μmol/L nitrite, respectively). DL and QL were determined using the standard deviation of the lowest concentration point on the standard curve. The major pedagogical value of this laboratory class was to scale down the official method and use it to prepare and analyze a solid food sample. As a learning model, finding real water samples, which have nitrite concentrations larger than method QL, was a hard task, but all sausage samples analyzed had larger nitrate concentrations than the method QL and nitrite quantification in sausages was a good learning model.},

  abstract = {What factors affect a scientist’s choice of research problem? Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an “essential tension” between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu’s field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.},

  abstract = {Chromatographic background drift correction, which influences peak detection and time shift alignment results, is a critical stage in chromatographic data analysis. In this study, an automatic background drift correction methodology was developed. Local minimum values in a chromatogram were initially detected and organized as a new baseline vector. Iterative optimization was then employed to recognize outliers, which belong to the chromatographic peaks, in this vector, and update the outliers in the baseline until convergence. The optimized baseline vector was finally expanded into the original chromatogram, and linear interpolation was employed to estimate background drift in the chromatogram. The principle underlying the proposed method was confirmed using a complex gas chromatographic dataset. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to eliminate background drift in liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight samples used in the metabolic study of Escherichia coli samples. The proposed method was comparable with three classical techniques: morphological weighted penalized least squares, moving window minimum value strategy and background drift correction by orthogonal subspace projection. The proposed method allows almost automatic implementation of background drift correction, which is convenient for practical use.},

The present study investigated the effects of a standardized freeze-dried powder made from fresh grapes, rich in grape-specific polyphenols and free of alcohol, on oxidative stress, atherogenicity of macrophages, and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E deficient (E0) mice. Thirty E0 mice were assigned to 3 groups. Mice consumed water alone (control), 150 ␮g total polyphenols/d in the form of grape powder (grape powder), or the equivalent amount of glucose and fructose (placebo) in drinking water for 10 wk. Consumption of grape powder reduced the atherosclerotic lesion area by 41\% (P Ͻ 0.0002) compared to the control or placebo mice. The antiatherosclerotic effect was at least partly due to a significant 8\% reduction in serum oxidative stress, an up to 22\% increase in serum antioxidant capacity, a significant 33\% reduction in macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL, and a 25\% decrease in macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL relative to controls. Grape powder directly protected both plasma LDL and macrophages from oxidative stress in vitro. We conclude that polyphenols from fresh grape powder directly affect macrophage atherogenicity by reducing macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL and cellular uptake of oxidized LDL. Both of these processes can eventually reduce macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation and hence attenuate atherosclerosis development. J. Nutr. 135: 722–728, 2005.},

Coupling CE to electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection unravels the separation mechanism.

Such analysis will provide insight into the role of these oligomers as stabilizers in emulsion polymerization, and into the mechanism of the RAFT polymerization with respect to degree of polymerization and tacticity.},

  abstract = {Purpose Consumer likeability and willingness to pay (WTP) for two Italian sparkling wines, (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco DOCG and Prosecco DOC) are evaluated through a non-hypothetical Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction during a wine-tasting experiment. The purpose of this paper is to estimate individual WTP and relate it to likeability for both wines, with and without supplying additional information on their features. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in May–June 2019 from a sample of 99 consumers in Northern Italy. A non-hypothetical BDM auction in a wine-tasting experiment was implemented. Findings The results show that the additional information plays a significant role in widening the WTP gap between the two geographical indications (GIs), while the blind tasting narrows this gap. The “superiority” of the Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco DOCG is confirmed but relies more on its better reputation than its better taste. Research limitations/implications The authors are aware of two main limitations in the study. The first is the territorial composition of the consumer sample. The second is the selection of the Prosecco bottles used in the experiment. The results are considered pioneering and need to be verified by additional experiments with different consumer and bottle samples. Practical implications Promotional suggestions for the Tutelary Consortia of the two GIs stem from the results. The Prosecco DOC should primarily stress its likeability, while the Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco DOCG should primarily emphasise the reasons for its “superiority”. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study has related likeability and WTP for similar GI wines produced in contiguous areas. Moreover, the current research has applied a non-hypothetical BDM auction in a wine-tasting experiment.},

A simple procedure is presented to determine the esterification degree of a hyaluronan derivative. In this case, the degree of substitution was as low as 14\%. The molecular weight distribution of mannuronic oligosaccharides mixture produced by hydrolysis of native polymannuronic is readily calculated from peak area of the species resolved by CE on the basis of a specific degree of polymerization. The influence of the applied electric field strength on the free solution mobility of hyaluronan samples is briefly addressed for molar masses of the order of 105 and 106 g/mol. The data are compared with the results obtained for a 50\% galactose-substituted hyaluronic acid (HA). Mobility data obtained as a function of buffer pH for a native HA sample as well as for two galactose-amide HA derivatives, having slightly different degrees of substitution, are presented and discussed in terms of the polymer charge density parameters . In most cases, more questions than answers arise from the application of CE to charged polysaccharides. However, perspectives are disclosed for a further understanding of the reliability of CE applied for the structural elucidation of such macromolecules.},

This set was unavoidable to select twelve cases, which are set out exhaustively in this study.Results and discussionLimiting ourselves to a purely psychiatric view, we can show the presence of psychopathology associated with exceptional states of consciousness, as would be ecstatic and mystical experience itself, present in most cases. We also found common psychological profiles, out of the sixty biographies and autobiographies of religious women analyzed: e.g. pain is used as a means of atonement and a way of removing the guilt of sin. We rule out major psychiatric disorders in the Santas we have analyzed. The behaviors they presented, even sometimes excessive, cannot be included in any of the current major psychiatric disorders.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.},

A machine learning approach was carried out to achieve the most important chemical parameters to differentiate Tempranillo and Tempranillo blanco grapes and wines based on the Kruskal-Wallis test, F-score feature selector, and support vector machine classification. Four importance levels were established for both grape and wine discrimination. The first level is composed of variables that can differentiate Tempranillo and Tempranillo blanco grapes and wines by analyzing the chemical concentrations. The second, third, and fourth level of importance is composed of a variable set that can correctly classify the samples, each one determined according to the F-score importance ranking and the SVM discriminations. Some chemical compounds demonstrated to be good predictors to wine and grape discriminations, whereas some chemicals are only a good predictor to one discrimination approach.},

In many cases, SEC is the only method available for analysis of the polymer. Here, we provide a derivation of the three molecular weight distributions from the raw concentration detector response data. The derivations are given in an easy to follow procedure. A method is derived to determine the molecular weight averages from the SEC data.

  abstract = {The assessment of wine traceability and authenticity is a major concern that has gained a lot of interest internationally since the wine has always been subjected to various fraudulent practices. Practiced since ancient times, wine fraud has become more sophisticated in the present day, taking many forms. Consumers, regulatory bodies and manufacturers are all interested to have reliable analytical tools and information to allow the authentication and detection of wine adulteration or incorrect labelling. This research study evaluates and proposes a possible strategy for the detection of adulterated sweet or medium sweet red table wines using appropriate chemical parameters which can reveal prohibited practices in the winemaking process. The work is performed on 29 table wine samples, bought from the market, packed in PET bottles. Exogenous addition of sugar and water in the counterfeited table red wines was detected by the measurement of stable isotopes content (δ13C and δ18O) known as origin markers and supplementary confirmed by other classical parameters, as the alcoholic strength of the wines (‰ vol.) and the presence of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF) and of synthetic sweeteners or synthetic red dyes used to correct deficiencies of taste and colour. Additionally, the nature and profile of anthocyanins, as indicator of the red colour of wine, was investigated in the table wines and then compared with that of authentic wines obtained by microvinification of Vitis vinifera, in order to determine their authenticity.},

  abstract = {Food adulteration is a threat to public health and the economy. In order to determine food adulteration efficiently, rapid and easy-to-use on-site analytical methods are needed. In this study, a miniaturized mass spectrometer in combination with three ambient ionization methods was used for food authentication. The chemical fingerprints of three milk types, five fish species, and two coffee types were measured using electrospray ionization, desorption electrospray ionization, and low temperature plasma ionization. Minimum sample preparation was needed for the analysis of liquid and solid food samples. Mass spectrometric data was processed using the laboratory-built software MS food classif ier, which allows for the definition of specific food profiles from reference data sets using multivariate statistical methods and the subsequent classification of unknown data. Applicability of the obtained mass spectrometric fingerprints for food authentication was evaluated using different data processing methods, leave-10\%-out cross-validation, and real-time classification of new data. Classification accuracy of 100\% was achieved for the differentiation of milk types and fish species, and a classification accuracy of 96.4\% was achieved for coffee types in crossvalidation experiments. Measurement of two milk mixtures yielded correct classification of {$>$}94\%. For real-time classification, the accuracies were comparable. Functionality of the software program and its performance is described. Processing time for a reference data set and a newly acquired spectrum was found to be 12 s and 2 s, respectively. These proof-of-principle experiments show that the combination of a miniaturized mass spectrometer, ambient ionization, and statistical analysis is suitable for on-site real-time food authentication.},

  abstract = {This work employs the application of three artificial intelligence (AI) techniques namely; support vector machine (SVM), Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for predicting the qualitative properties of an anti-Alzheimer agent using high-pressure liquid chromatography technique. The mobile phase (inform of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid) and the column temperature was used as the predictors in modelling the maximum retention time (tR-max) and resolution (Resol.) as the output variables of the analyte. The measured and predicted values were checked using three performance indices including; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (CC) as the goodness of fits and a statistical error inform of root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results obtained demonstrated the promising ability of AI-based models in modelling the qualitative properties of the anti-Alzheimer agent. Observation of different outputs of the AI-based models at various time intervals showed the necessity of ensembling the outputs of the AI-based models. Therefore, simple average ensemble and support vector machine ensemble (SVM-E) were employed to enhance the performance skills of the simple models. The comparative performance of SVM-E inform of NSE indicated its ability in boosting and enhancing the performance skills of the single models SVM, MLP and HW models up to 5, 13 and 20\% respectively in the testing stage for modelling tR-max.},

Peak overlap is common in disordered distributions, even with a very high peak capacity. It is therefore of great importance to understand the origin of peak order/disorder in multidimensional separations and to address the question of whether any control can be exerted over observed levels of order and disorder and thus separation efficacy.},

It updates the study that was prepared for Wine Australia in 2015. The Australian wine sector includes grape growing, wine making and wine-related tourism. The wine sector makes a direct and significant contribution to output (the gross value of business turnover), gross domestic product (GDP) and employment. In addition to the wine sector’s direct economic contribution, the sector also makes a flow-on contribution via strong linkages to other businesses that supply goods and services required for grape growing, wine making and the wine tourism experience, as well as the goods and services demanded by employees. Wine grapes are grown in every Australian state with South Australia, NSW and Victoria being the largest wine grape producers. In 2018 there were estimated to be 6,251 wine grape growers with a vineyard area of 146,128 ha generating a gross wine grape sales value of \$1.11 billion. Wine is Australia’s fifth largest agricultural export industry. In 2018 there were estimated to be 2,468 Australian wineries and total Australian wine production was 1.29 billion litres with a gross value to the wine makers of \$6.3 billion. Australian wine is export oriented with approximately 60\% of output headed for wine markets including China, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Hong Kong.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an HPLC method for analysing a great variety of phenolic compounds from vine and wine products with UV-Vis photodiode array (DAD) and fluorescence detection. In order to obtain a good chromatographic separation, a ternary solvent gradient that combines changes in polarity and pH was used. The pH changes from 2.6 to 1.5 to promote the elution of anthocyanins in their flavylium cationic form. The fluorescence detector enables the limit of quantification of flavan-3-ols to be reduced, and also prevents interferences caused by other phenolics that force the use of time-consuming fractionating protocols. With this method, it was possible to separate and quantify up to 48 phenolic compounds in a single, direct injection: 2 benzoic acids (DAD set at 280nm), 9 hydroxycinnamic acids and GRP (DAD set at 320nm), 7 flavan-3-ols (5 with fluorescence detector set at excitation/emission of 280/320nm, and 2 with DAD set at 280nm), 12 flavonols (DAD set at 360nm), 15 anthocyanins (DAD set at 520nm), and 2 stilbens (DAD set at 320nm). Studies were performed to determine the precision, accuracy, and detection limits and data are provided on the concentration of the phenolics found in grape seed and skin extracts, as well as in wines prepared from the Vitis vinifera cultivar Cencibel.},

Not only the high quality of beans but also roasting and brewing times guarantee the best taste and quality of coffee beverages. The aim of the present experiment was to determine the best level of roasting and brewing time for organic and conventional coffee. The experiment was carried out with Peru coffee beans from organic and conventional farms. The contents of caffeine and bioactive compounds were measured in different roasted and brewed coffee drinks. The obtained results showed that the conventional coffee contained significantly more caffeine, total flavonoids, and quercetin derivatives than the organic coffee. On the other hand, the organic coffee was characterized by a higher level of almost all bioactive compounds. The best level of roasting was determined to be medium, and the optimal brewing time was 3 minutes.},

The system incorporated a C18 column as one dimension and a carbon clad zirconia column as the second dimension. In order to study the resolving power of this system, the separation of a sample matrix containing an artificial mix of 32 isomers (structural and diastereoisomers) was evaluated. Using this system, between 25 and 28 of the 32 isomers could be separated, depending on the mobile phase combinations—with resolution that could not possibly be achieved in a single one dimensional separation. The results from this study indicate that in order to fully evaluate the resolving power of a 2D system multiple methods of analysis are most appropriate. This becomes increasingly important when the sample contains components that are very closely related and the retention of solutes is clustered in one quadrant of the 2D space. Ultimately, the usefulness of the 2D separation is determined by the goals of analyst.},

  abstract = {The development of a two-dimensional liquid chromatographic system requires a process of assessment that can yield an optimum performing system with minimal experimental evaluation. Information Theory and a geometric approach to Factor Analysis are two techniques that when used in combination, provide important information on the expected two-dimensional performance. In the present study, we compare the predicted separation performance of two-dimensional systems that have been subjected to analysis by Information Theory and Factor Analysis to that of actual chromatographic separation performance. Our test separation comprised a mixture of 32 oligostyrene structural isomers and stereoisomers. The optimal combination as determined by Information Theory and Factor Analysis consisted of a C18 column with a methanol mobile phase in the first dimension and a carbon clad zirconia column with an acetonitrile mobile phase in the second dimension. This system was also shown to be the most successful practical system when a heart-cutting approach was employed. The practical results were in total agreement with the results from Information Theory and Factor Analysis. The number of isomers resolved using this system was 27. A second system, namely one comprising of a C18 column and methanol mobile phase in the first dimension and a carbon clad zirconia column with a methanol mobile phase in the second dimension was also predicted to be a system with high separation potential. However, practical assessment of this system did not realise the theoretical predictions, largely due to the long separation times required in the second dimension. Furthermore, all combinations that employed a C18 column with an acetonitrile mobile phase in the first dimension failed to realise the theoretical separation potential due to high solute crowding, low orthogonality and a disordered arrangement of bands along the first separation axis. This was also predicted by the theoretical assessment.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive two-dimensional reversed-phase reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system for the separation of a complex mixture of oligostyrenes was developed using results from a previous theoretical assessment of the informational similarity, percent synentropy, orthogonality and peak capacity of hypothetically coupled systems. The degree of sample attribute order in the first separation dimension was also used in the development of the experimental two-dimensional system. A C18(methanol)/CCZ(acetonitrile) two-dimensional system was chosen for the comprehensive analysis of the oligostyrene mixtures because this system had the lowest solute crowding, highest orthogonality and was observed to have order with respect to a sample attribute in the first separation dimension. The separations achieved were in full agreement with the results from information theory and (a geometric approach to) factor analysis assessments. High sampling rates in the first liquid chromatographic dimension were shown to be impossible or inefficient when the peak capacity and separation time of the second dimension was high or when the aim of the exercise was to isolate individual sample constituents in high yield.},

  abstract = {This article is not a biographic description of the life of Csaba Horvath, but an attempt to describe his most important contributions to liquid chromatography, as viewed by an author who himself started with HPLC in 1973. With the introduction of columns packed with rigid pellicular particles, which could withstand high pressures, the combination of fast separations with high efficiency was designated high pressure liquid chromatography about 35 years ago. The contribution of Horvath to the birth of modern LC was to imagine the potential for high-speed separations in LC by transferring ideas and technology from gas chromatography. From this time, his strong participation in understanding and describing the processes of separation science made him a leading scientist in fundamental studies of separation principles until his passing away in April 2004. In addition to being one of the forefathers of modern liquid chromatography, Csaba Horvath described both the ionic interactions and the hydrophobic interactions on ion exchangers as well as on reversed phase materials and developed a theoretical basis for understanding these processes. If one person should be mentioned as the inventor of ion-pair chromatography of organic compounds, of hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and of the theoretical basis for reversed phase chromatography, this person is Csaba Horvath. Throughout the last 30 years he also had a strong interest in studying proteins in separation processes, and in the last decade he made valuable contributions to capillary electrochromatography, particularly for separation of proteins on monolithic columns. For this author is difficult to find another person who has had a greater impact on liquid chromatography than Csaba Horvath.},

The spectral region selected for each model was between 1550 and 824 cm−1. The PLS1 model showed the best predictive capacity for simultaneous prediction of the six parameters. Excellent values of the coefficient of determination in validation (Rv2; 0.93–0.95) and residual predictive deviation (RPD; 4.28–6.95) were obtained for TPC, FC, ABTS and DPPH.

The liquid-solid mass transfer of proteins (e.g., insulin and lyzozyme) is exceptionally fast on Kinetex-C-18 much faster than on the Halo-C-18 column.

The overall reduced HETP was derived from the true moments of the recorded concentration profiles. The longitudinal diffusion HETP term was measured at a very small flow rate (0.05 mL/min). The solid-liquid mass transfer resistance was derived from the shell diffusivity, using the composite Garnett-Torquato model of effective diffusion in a heterogeneous system made of a dense packing of core-shell particles immersed in a continuous matrix (the eluent). The trans-channel and short-range interchannel eddy dispersion HETP terms were assumed to be equal to the calculated h data after solving the Navier-Stokes equation and simulating the advection-diffusion transport process. Experimental results confirmed that the optimum efficiency of these short columns was increased by a factor of about two. The ratio of the detection sensitivities on the PSFC stream and on a regular stream increased from 1 to 1.45 when the retention factor decreases from about 10 to 0.5. These phenomena are due to a strong reduction of the trans-column eddy dispersion HETP term. The system loses about 60\% of the sample mass when only outlet skimming is carried out when the flow rate ratio of 55\% is applied, as was done in this work. It loses about 50\% of the sample when inlet/outlet segmentation is applied. In gradient elution, the peak capacity is increased by only 15\%, due to post-column band spreading, which should imperatively be minimized when the outlet flow is split. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The mass transfer kinetics in short and wide 4.6 mm x 30 mm columns packed with 3.0 mu m Hypurity-C-18 fully porous particles were measured for three different configurations of the inlet sample distribution and outlet sample collection: (1) both the inlet and outlet column endfittings are standard, (2) the inlet endfitting is standard while the outlet endfitting allows parallel segmentation of the exiting flow between a central and a peripheral region across the column diameter, and (3) both the inlet and outlet endfittings allow a parallel segmentation of the flow entering and exiting the column, respectively. The total reduced heights equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) were carefully measured, using the first and second central moments of the elution band profiles, obtained by its accurate numerical integration. The longitudinal diffusion term was measured at the lowest experimental reduced velocity applied. The solid-liquid mass transfer resistance was estimated from measurements of the intra-particle diffusivity using the Torquato's model of effective diffusion in packed beds. The trans-channel and short-range interchannel eddy diffusion HETP terms were taken from data obtained by solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equations and simulating advective-diffusive transport in computer-generated random sphere packings. The results clearly show that the trans-column eddy diffusion HETP term can account for up to 85\% of the total intrinsic HETP (corrected for extra-column contributions) of the standard columns. Parallel segmented flow chromatography can reduce this contribution by half at high velocities, by eliminating most of the baseline peak tailing. This holds true irrespective of the retention factor of the analyte. It was found also that segmenting the inlet/outlet flow increases detection sensitivity by 25-50\% for peaks with large to small retention factors, respectively. In practice, the advantage of parallel segmented flow chromatography in gradient elution (thin peak widths) is essentially limited by post-column bandspreading and diffusion in the dwell volume of the instrument used. Analyst should minimize post-column bandspreading (caused by connectors and detection cell volume) and synchronize the eluent composition in the peripheral and central inlet ports of the column, by using two separate pumps with appropriate dwell volumes.

For each column length and particle type, two different configurations were tested: (1) both the inlet and outlet column endfittings were standard and (2) the inlet endfitting was standard but the outlet endfitting allowed parallel segmentation of the exiting flow into a central and a peripheral coaxial region. The segmentation flow ratio was set at 45\% (for 3 mu m) and at 43\% or 21\% (for 5 mu m). Four samples were used, naphthalene, toluene, butylbenzene, and insulin, which has a ten times smaller diffusion coefficient than the small molecules. The column performance for the low molecular weight compound is significantly improved at velocities above the optimum value when the outlet flow rate is segmented because longitudinal diffusion and mass transfer resistance of this compound in the stationary phase are negligible sources of band broadening at reduced linear velocities between 5 and 25. At high flow rate (4 mL/min), the long-range eddy dispersion terms are about 3.9, 3.2, 2.6, and 1.8 h unit lower for the 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 cm long columns, respectively. The longer the column, the lower the efficiency improvement because the border effects are smaller. This result was not systematically observed for the columns packed with 5 mu m particles because the transverse dispersion is larger. In contrast, the gain in column efficiency is marginal for insulin because the mass transfer mechanism of this compound is mostly controlled by the slow diffusivity of insulin across Hypurity-C-18 particles.

  abstract = {Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) chromatograms typically exhibit run-to-run retention time variability. Chromatogram alignment is often a desirable step prior to further analysis of the data, for example, in studies of environmental forensics or weathering of complex mixtures. We present a new algorithm for aligning whole GC × GC chromatograms. This technique is based on alignment points that have locations indicated by the user both in a target chromatogram and in a reference chromatogram. We applied the algorithm to two sets of samples. First, we aligned the chromatograms of twelve compositionally distinct oil spill samples, all analyzed using the same instrument parameters. Second, we applied the algorithm to two compositionally distinct wastewater extracts analyzed using two different instrument temperature programs, thus involving larger retention time shifts than the first sample set. For both sample sets, the new algorithm performed favorably compared to two other available alignment algorithms: that of Pierce, K. M.; Wood, Lianna F.; Wright, B. W.; Synovec, R. E. Anal. Chem. 2005, 77, 7735–7743 and 2-D COW from Zhang, D.; Huang, X.; Regnier, F. E.; Zhang, M. Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 2664–2671. The new algorithm achieves the best matches of retention times for test analytes, avoids some artifacts which result from the other alignment algorithms, and incurs the least modification of quantitative signal information.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Lung cancer is a malignant tumour, and early diagnosis has been shown to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients. In this study, we assessed the use of plasma metabolites as biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis. In this work, we used a novel interdisciplinary mechanism, applied for the first time to lung cancer, to detect biomarkers for early lung cancer diagnosis by combining metabolomics and machine learning approaches. Results\enspace{} In total, 478 lung cancer patients and 370 subjects with benign lung nodules were enrolled from a hospital in Dalian, Liaoning Province. We selected 47 serum amino acid and carnitine indicators from targeted metabolomics studies using LC‒MS/MS and age and sex demographic indicators of the subjects. After screening by a stepwise regression algorithm, 16 metrics were included. The XGBoost model in the machine learning algorithm showed superior predictive power (AUC\,=\,0.81, accuracy\,=\,75.29\%, sensitivity\,=\,74\%), with the metabolic biomarkers ornithine and palmitoylcarnitine being potential biomarkers to screen for lung cancer. The machine learning model XGBoost is proposed as an tool for early lung cancer prediction. This study provides strong support for the feasibility of bloodbased screening for metabolites and provide a safer, faster and more accurate tool for early diagnosis of lung cancer. Conclusions\enspace{} This study proposes an interdisciplinary approach combining metabolomics with a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict early the occurrence of lung cancer. The metabolic biomarkers ornithine and palmitoylcarnitine showed significant power for early lung cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Today scientists must deal with complex samples that either cannot be adequately separated using one-dimensional chromatography or that require an inordinate amount of time for separation. For these cases we need two-dimensional chromatography because it takes far less time to generate a peak capacity n c twice in a row than to generate a peak capacity n c 2 once. Liquid chromatography has been carried out successfully on thin layers of adsorbents and along tubes filled with various adsorbents. The first type of separation sorts out the sample components in a physical separation space that is the layer of packing material. The analysis time is the same for all the components of the sample while their migration distance increases with decreasing retention. The resolution between two components having a certain separation factor ( α ) increases with increasing migration distance, i.e., from the strongly to the weakly retained compounds. In the second type of separation, the sample components are eluted from the column and separated in the time space, their migration distances are all the same while their retention times increase from the unretained to the strongly retained compounds. Separation efficiency varies little with retention, as long as the components are eluted from the column. We call these two types of separation the chromatographic separations in space (LC x ) and the chromatographic separations in time (LC t ), respectively. In principle, there are four ways to combine these two modes and do two-dimensional chromatographic separations, LC t × LC t , LC x × LC t , LC t × LC x , and LC x × LC x . We review, discuss and compare the potential performance of these combinations, their advantages, drawbacks, problems, perspectives and results. Currently, column-based combinations ( LC t × LC t ) are the most actively pursued. We suggest that the combination LC x × LC t shows exceptional promise because it permits the simultaneous second-dimension separations of all the fractions separated in the first-dimension, thus providing remarkable time saving.},

  abstract = {The practical limit of the separation power of HPLC depends on time, money, and skill. That is it depends on the time available for the analysis, on the quality and performance of the pump and hardware and particularly on the maximum pressure at which the pump can deliver the mobile phase to the column, and on the temperature at which the column can be operated. It also depends on the properties of the packing material selected (e.g., its particle size, its pore geometry, and its connectivity) and on the packing method used since it affects the coefficients of the HETP equation. Finally, it depends on the thermal stability of the sample and the packing material. The complexity of the sample also plays an important role in that it determines whether the analysis should be made under isocratic, isothermal conditions, in gradient elution, in temperature programming, or with a combination of both types of programming. The various phenomena that affect column properties and separation performance are discussed. Past achievements suggest that columns providing efficiencies in excess of a million plates in less than 1 day are within the grasp of current technology. The possibility of further advances are considered.},

The origin of the concept, the differences between their characteristics and those of traditional packed columns, their advantages and drawbacks, the methods of preparation of monoliths of different forms, and the current status of the field are reviewed. The actual and potential performance of monolithic columns are compared with those of packed columns. Monolithic columns have considerable advantages, which makes them most useful in many applications of liquid chromatography.

Via 2D 600 MHz NMR and LC-MS, 16-O-methylcafestol and 16-O-methylkahweol were detected for the first time in Arabica roast coffee and shown to be responsible for the marker peak.

  abstract = {Wine is one of the most consumed beverages around the world. It is composed of alcohols, sugars, acids, minerals, proteins and other compounds, such as organic acids and volatile and phenolic compounds (also called polyphenols). Polyphenols have been shown to be highly related to both (i) wine quality (color, flavor, and taste) and (ii) health-promoting properties (antioxidant and cardioprotective among others). Polyphenols can be grouped into two big families: (i) Flavonoids, including anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanols, hydrolysable and condensed tannins, flavanones, flavones and chalcones; and (ii) Non-flavonoids, including hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, stilbenes, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Each group affects in some way the different properties of wine to a greater or a lesser extent. For that reason, the phenolic composition can be managed to obtain singular wines with specific, desirable characteristics. The current review presents a summary of the ways in which the phenolic composition of wine can be modulated, including (a) invariable factors such as variety, field management or climatic conditions; (b) pre-fermentative strategies such as maceration, thermovinification and pulsed electric field; (c) fermentative strategies such as the use of different yeasts and bacteria; and (d) post-fermentative strategies such as maceration, fining agents and aging. Finally, the different extraction methods and analytical techniques used for polyphenol detection and quantification have been also reviewed.},

Global warming provokes an increase in the accumulation of soluble solids in grapes, together with a lower content of anthocyanins and acidity. This result in stuck and sluggish fermentations causing economic losses in the winery. Climate adaptation strategies are essential to minimize the detrimental effects of global warming on grape and wine quality. This review summarized the effect of viticultural techniques to delay grapevine ripening with emphasis on canopy management and we overviewed the effects of high temperatures on grape and wine quality. Some viticultural techniques such as severe shoot trimming, minimal pruning, late winter pruning and apical leaf removal may delay grapevine ripening close to 15~days. Forcing regrowth is the most interesting technique since it allows to delay grape ripening at least of two months which can be essential in warm grapevine production areas.},

Design/methodology/approach                                A survey of 254 respondents for questions relating to objective wine knowledge and frequency of wine consumption, as well as the aesthetics and ephemerality of wine consumption was conducted. Clustering analysis was used to produce four discrete consumer clusters that provide insight into Berthon                 et al.                 ’s (2009) aesthetic and ontology (AO) framework for the consumption of luxury wine brands.                                                        Findings               The paper finds that four clusters of wine consumers can be identified that exhibit common characteristics outlined in the AO framework.                                         Practical implications               By clustering consumers and mapping these clusters, the AO framework provides wine marketers with a useful tool to segment the luxury wine market and to develop and deploy tailored wine marketing strategies to target each segment effectively.                                         Originality/value               This study is one of the first to investigate the relationship between consumer wine knowledge, aesthetics and ephemerality. It offers luxury wine marketers useful insights into targeting wine consumers according to their common characteristics.},

  abstract = {Scientific Data Analysis Toolkit (SDAT) is a rigorous, versatile, and user-friendly data analysis add-in application for Microsoft Excel for Windows (PC). SDAT uses the familiar Excel environment to carry out most of the analytical tasks used in data analysis. It has been designed for student use in manipulating and analyzing data encountered in the physical and biological sciences, from first-year courses, to the graduate level, and in research. A particularly useful feature of SDAT is its ability to perform rigorous regression analysis using both standard and user-defined model functions. This tool, which can accommodate up to seven fitting parameters, provides the standard deviation of regression of the fit, the standard uncertainties of the fitting parameters, and the covariance matrix. It also supports weighted regression analysis. SDAT includes the following functionalities: Descriptive Statistics, Integrate, Differentiate, Smooth, Spline, Plot, and Regression Analysis. The use of the Regression Analysis tool is illustrated with several examples including the unweighted and weighted analysis of the nonlinear and linearized forms an exponential decay and an example of the use of the covariance term in a propagation of errors calculation. Other example topics are chemical and enzyme kinetics, vapor pressure, and quantum chemistry computational results. SDAT is provided as associated content.},

  abstract = {This chapter summarizes the chemotaxonomic study of medicinal plants and focuses on the chemical classification, as well as its relationship with morphology-based taxonomy and molecular biology classification. Both primary metabolites and secondary metabolites (SMs) are used as chemotaxonomic markers. Fatty acid, alkane, and alkyne are most commonly used primary metabolites. In comparison, more categories of SM are used in chemotaxonomy, such as essential oil and volatile terpene, diterpene, triterpene/saponin, alkaloid, flavonoid, lignin, and phenolics. The combined use of various classification methods could provide most robust taxonomy system. Developing metabolomics and cheminformatics tools, as well as constructing relevant databases, is highlighted in the new trend of chemotaxonomy. Due to the short supply of plant-based drugs in the current market, the medicinal plant classification studies should highlight combining pharmacological research to expand the herbal drug sources.},

HA was observed at around 15 min by using an untreated fused-silica capillary (75 Ixm I.D.) of 58 cm length (effective length, 50 cm) at 20 kV in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4.0). Calibration curves showed good linearity from 0.01 mg/ml to 3.3 mg/ml for all HA samples examined. The lower limit of detection by monitoring the absorbance at 185 nm was 1.0 Ixg/ml at the signal-to-noise ratio of 5. HA samples were examined in a buffer containing pullulan (PU) as an additive for the matrix formation material. The HA samples showed marked peak-broadening when analyzed in the buffer solution containing PU with a specified molecular mass. The peak broadening was based on the dispersion of the molecular mass of the HA sample analyzed.},

  abstract = {The performance of a particle packed column will inevitably degrade through use or misadventure. 'Active flow technology' (AFT) is known to greatly improve the performance of pristine columns, but is as of yet untested when used on columns that have degraded significantly. In this study AFT was used to regenerate a degraded column, where the reduced plate height and asymmetry values were 3.5 and 1.25 respectively. Once the AFT fittings were fitted to the column outlet and the flow segmentation ratio adjusted to 28\% from the radial central exit port, the reduced plate height decreased to 2.0, and the bands were almost perfectly symmetrical with asymmetry factors equal to 1.04. Subsequently, the performance of the degraded column with AFT fittings provided performance that was comparable to that of a new conventional column fitted with traditional end fittings. The separation power of the degraded conventional column and that of the same column fitted with the AFT end fittings was then tested using the separation of oligostyrenes. In AFT mode, detection was undertaken at both the radial central exit port of the column and the peripheral exit port. The resulting separation that was achieved from the radial central exit port was superior to that observed on the conventional column, whereas, the separation observed from the peripheral port was very poor. It was subsequently determined that the reason for the degraded performance of the conventional column was a result of increased heterogeneity associated with the packing material in the wall region of the column.

  abstract = {This chapter provides an introduction to chemoinformatics covering multivariate mathematical–statistical methods for data evaluation. It is expedient to distinguish the variables on the basis of three scales: nominal, ordinal, and numeric. The nominal scales are qualitative only and can be measured solely in terms of whether the individual items belong to some distinctively different categories. The ordinal scales are also qualitative, but they can rank (order) the items measured in terms of which has less and which has more of the quality represented by the variable, and the numerical scale is quantitative in nature. There are numerous applications evaluating results of instrumental–analytical methods such as mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chromatography using chemoinformatics. Combinations involving NMR spectroscopy and chromatography have many applications in the biomedical field. On the other hand, although chemometric techniques are frequently applied to analyze mass spectral data, applications in the biomedical field are rare. Multivariate data analysis is applied to mass spectrometry, especially revealing relationships of mass spectral data and chemical structure. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and chemometrics are coupled to analyze the adulteration of orange juice quantitatively, to test the authenticity of honey, and to discriminate the unfractionated plant extracts.},

  abstract = {This video will show you how to install Latex, and make your first PDF output on Windows 10. This is not the only software or method for doing it, just the way that has worked best for me. You will just need to install 2 software packages, MiKTeX and Texmaker. Texmaker is the editor for Latex, where MiKTeX handles the compiling. MiKTeX can be downloaded from: https://miktex.org/help Texmaker can be downloaded from: http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/downl... After you have them downloaded, just run through the installation. You can essentially select the defaults for installation for both. Once the installations are finished, open Texmaker. To make your first Latex document, just click on new at the top left. After that, I would paste in some known working Latex so you can test it out. In the video I used: http://mally.stanford.edu/\textasciitilde sr/computi... Click the arrow to the left of quick build to compile the latex document. It should ask you if you want to install lingmacros, because it is the first time that has been used, so just click yes to install it. It will not ask you if you want to install tree-dvips because that is included in the Latex installation already. After the package installation is completed, then the compiled PDF will show up on the right. If you make a change and compile again, it will compile much faster because it has all of the packages required. Check out my facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/pages/All-Ho... or my twitter: https://twitter.com/AllHow2s Or my website where I have a lot of other great tutorials (such as how to take a screenshot, or how to get the start button back on Windows 8): http://www.allhow2s.com},

This group of compounds was not selected at random but according to their pharmocoligical effects. For these compounds it was observed that the m/e values of the peaks in the mass spectra are highly correlated, while a number of chromatographic columns can be found on which the retention data are only slightly correlated. As a result, the information content of two-dimensional gas chromatographic retention data on such columns equals the information content of binary-encoded low-resolution mass spectra. It is shown that the accuracy and precision of retention data in gas-liquid chromatography, and therefore the information content, can be significantly improved if the data are corrected for adsorption effects of the solid support and extrapolated to a limiting value in the case of asymmetric peaks.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the chemistry of wine would help defining its quality, chemical and sensory characteristics and optimise the wine-making processes. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV–Vis spectroscopy (HPLC–UV–Vis) is a common analysis method used to obtain the molecular profile of wine samples. We propose a complete procedure for the analysis of wine chromatograms. Data are pre-processed using standard methods of down-sampling, smoothing and baseline subtraction. Multiple samples are then merged in a three-dimensional tensor, decomposed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC2) into three factors: (i) one reduced (rank-one) chromatogram per sample, (ii) an estimate of the samples’ spectral UV–Vis profile and (iii) an estimate of the samples’ concentrations. If the decomposition is performed on a single peak of the tensor, the second and third factors correspond to the representative wavelength spectrum and to the relative concentrations of the samples, respectively. Otherwise, when multiple peaks are analysed, further processing is required. In the latter case, the decomposed rank-one chromatograms are peak-detected and aligned, clustered and integrated. A table containing the concentration of the peaks at different retention times is obtained. The pipeline proposed in this study is a guideline for a quantitative and reproducible chemical analysis of wine, or other samples, via the HPLC–UV–Vis method.},

A total of 19 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified using HPLC-DAD and among them, malvidin-3-glucoside and its derivatives were the major compounds, followed by the petunidin derivatives, while caftaric acid was the predominant cinnamic acid derivative in all wines. The anthocyanin content was mainly affected by the grape variety and to a less extent by the yeast used in fermentation. In particular, the use of locally isolated yeasts affected higher amount of anthocyanins and phenolic acids compared to the wines fermented with commercial yeasts.

  abstract = {We describe how complex concepts in macroscopic chemistry, namely, thermodynamics and kinetics, can be taught at considerable depth both at the first-year undergraduate as well as upper levels. We begin with a careful treatment of PV diagrams, and by pictorially integrating the appropriate area in a PV diagram, we introduce work. This starting point allows us to elucidate the concept of state functions and nonstate functions. The students readily appreciate that for a given transition, the area enclosed by the PV curve (work) depends on the path taken. It is then argued that heat, within this chosen framework, is a consequence of energy conservation and the fact that work is not a state function. This leads to a visual introduction of all the components involved in the first law of thermodynamics. The PV diagrams are then used to introduce entropy as being related to the maximum possible work to be done by the system. This macroscopic description of entropy is then related to the usual microscopic view of Boltzmann. This equivalence connects the area inside the PV diagram (work from a specific kind of pathway) and the number of microstates involved in the Boltzmann expression. The connection between the macroscopic and microscopic description of entropy also illuminates the exponential dependence of the number of microstates (or probability) on an energy, known as free energy. The Arrhenius picture of chemical kinetics then readily follows from the exponential dependence stated above, and finally, a reactive event is viewed as a statistically rare event, to further clarify the appearance of entropy in the rate expression.},

Excellent limits of detection in the low lg LÀ1 range were achieved. Reversed phase HPLC employing sub-2 lm particles as stationary phase allowed high-throughput analysis with analysis times of 10 min for 11 compounds. The phenolic pattern was assessed in 97 authentic wine samples (stored under identical conditions without further treatment or modification) comprising eleven geographical Austrian regions, six grape varieties and five vintages. Canonical discriminant analysis was applied to the data set showing the suitability of the (poly)phenolic spectrum for classification of the wine samples. The method allowed a geographic discrimination of several grape varieties and a grape variety based discrimination of four regions. As a novel finding excellent (poly)phenol-based differentiation of the five investigated vintages (2003–2007) was achieved.},

The results showed that the contents of phenolic compounds and the levels of antioxidant activity in the wine samples greatly varied with cultivar and environmental factors of vine growth. The contents of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines from the Yuquanying region of Ningxia were significantly higher than other three regions, followed by the wines from Shacheng region of Hebei, and these parameters were the lowest in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines from the Changli regions of Hebei and Xiangning region of Shanxi. Taken together, a close relationship between phenolic subclasses and antioxidant activity was observed for the wine samples. Moreover, there were significant discrepancies in the individual phenolic composition and content of four regional Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines, among which the individual phenolic compounds (catechin, epicatechin, cinnamic acid, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, laricitrin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside) revealed a significant correlation (p {$<$} 0.05) with the antioxidant capacity in present study, especially for catechin and epicatechin.},

To reduce the data matrices two strategies were employed: (1) multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and (2) a new strategy proposed in this work based on the fusion of the mean data profiles in both spectral and time domains. Several conventional chemometric tools were then applied to both raw and reduced data: principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA) and n-way partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA). Furthermore, an emergent multivariate classification method known as random forest (RF) has been first applied to second-order data. It was shown that RF is more efficient than conventional tools. Indeed, the obtained sensibility, specificity and accuracy are 1.00, 0.92 and 0.95 respectively; these performance metrics are significantly better than the values found for the other methods.},

Several pattern recognition tools have been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of available trial data. The most widely used methods are principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). Nevertheless, there are alternative data treatment methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF), that show a great potential and more advantages compared to conventional ones. In this paper, we explain the background of these methods and review and discuss the reported studies in which these three methods have been applied in the area of food quality and authenticity. In addition, we clarify the technical terminology used in this particular area of research.},

Some of the earliest reported cases of food fraud, dating back thousands of years, involved olive oil, tea, wine, and spices. These products continue to be associated with fraud, along with some other foods. Although the vast majority of fraud incidents do not pose a public health risk, some cases have resulted in actual or potential public health risks. Perhaps the most high-profile case has involved the addition of melamine to high-protein feed and milk-based products to artificially inflate protein values in products that may have been diluted. In 2007, pet food adulterated with melamine reportedly killed a large number of dogs and cats in the United States, followed by reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula had sickened thousands of Chinese children. Fraud was also a motive behind Peanut Corporation of America’s actions in connection with the Salmonella outbreak in 2009, which killed 9 people and sickened 700. Reports also indicate that fish and seafood fraud is widespread, consisting mostly of a lowervalued species, which may be associated with some types of food poisoning or allergens, mislabeled as a higher-value species. Other types of foods associated with fraud include honey, meat and grain-based foods, fruit juices, organic foods, coffee, and some highly processed foods.},

  abstract = {Post Column derivatisation (PCD) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography or ultra-high performance liquid chromatography is a powerful tool in the modern analytical laboratory, or at least it should be. One drawback with PCD techniques is the extra post-column dead volume due to reaction coils used to enable adequate reaction time and the mixing of reagents which causes peak broadening, hence a loss of separation power. This loss of efficiency is counter-productive to modern HPLC technologies, -such as UHPLC. We reviewed 87 PCD methods published from 2009 to 2014. We restricted our review to methods published between 2009 and 2014, because we were interested in the uptake of PCD methods in UHPLC environments. Our review focused on a range of system parameters including: column dimensions, stationary phase and particle size, as well as the geometry of the reaction loop. The most commonly used column in the methods investigated was not in fact a modern UHPLC version with sub-2-micron, (or even sub-3-micron) particles, but rather, work-house columns, such as, 250 x 4.6 mm i.d. columns packed with 5 mu m C18 particles. Reaction loops were varied, even within the same type of analysis, but the majority of methods employed loop systems with volumes greater than 500 mu L. A second part of this review illustrated briefly the effect of dead volume on column performance. The experiment evaluated the change in resolution and separation efficiency of some weak to moderately retained solutes on a 250 x 4.6 mm i.d. column packed with 5 mu m particles. The data showed that reaction loops beyond 100 mu L resulted in a very serious loss of performance. Our study concluded that practitioners of PCD methods largely avoid the use of UHPLC-type column formats, so yes, very much, PCD is incompatible with the modern HPLC column.

  abstract = {A protocol for the use of reaction flow high performance liquid chromatography columns for methods employing post column derivatization (PCD) is presented. A major difficulty in adapting PCD to modern HPLC systems and columns is the need for large volume reaction coils that enable reagent mixing and then the derivatization reaction to take place. This large post column dead volume leads to band broadening, which results in a loss of observed separation efficiency and indeed detection in sensitivity. In reaction flow post column derivatization (RF-PCD) the derivatization reagent(s) are pumped against the flow of mobile phase into either one or two of the outer ports of the reaction flow column where it is mixed with column effluent inside a frit housed within the column end fitting. This technique allows for more efficient mixing of the column effluent and derivatization reagent(s) meaning that the volume of the reaction loops can be minimized or even eliminated altogether. It has been found that RF-PCD methods perform better than conventional PCD methods in terms of observed separation efficiency and signal to noise ratio. A further advantage of RF-PCD techniques is the ability to monitor effluent coming from the central port in its underivatized state. RF-PCD has currently been trialed on a relatively small range of post column reactions, however, there is currently no reason to suggest that RF-PCD could not be adapted to any existing one or two component (as long as both reagents are added at the same time) post column derivatization reaction.},

Calcidiol (25(OH)D) concentrations are used in the determination of vitamin D deficiency in humans, and there is growing interest and demand in its analysis with some controversy surrounding the sensitivity and specificity of its detection. 25(OH)D analysis is currently performed using either competitive binding assays or HPLC analysis, coupled with detection by a variety of means, such as, UV-Vis absorption, electrochemical or mass spectroscopy (MS) detection. HPLC coupled with MS (HPLC-MS) detection is the gold standard for 25(OH)D analysis due to its sensitivity and selectivity compared to all other techniques, however, its utility is limited by its high cost.

  abstract = {High performance liquid chromatography coupled with post column derivatisation (HPLC-PCD) may be used to profile the antioxidant content of a sample. There are, however, drawbacks in the use of HPLCPCD setups; namely the high volume reaction coils that are typically used lowering the observed separation efficiency. Reaction flow chromatography has the ability to overcome these inefficiencies by using a more efficient mixing technique inside the outlet fitting itself, post column reaction loops can be removed with resulting improvement in signal to noise response, plus the separation efficiency is maintained. We assessed two methods of HPLC-PCD antioxidant analysis based on the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay in both conventional and reaction flow HPLC-PCD modes. It was found that the reaction flow technique demonstrated significant advantages over the conventional technique in terms of signal to noise, linear range, precision and observed separation efficiency.},

  abstract = {This is the first study to employ a reaction flow (RF) HPLC column of a short 5 cm length to identify antioxidants in a variety of complex samples represented by tea, utilising simultaneous multiplexed detection techniques. The detection responses included: underivatised UV at 280 nm, underivatised fluorescence detection (FLD) and a post column derivatisation (PCD) colorimetric response for antioxidants via the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Both similarities and differences in the chromatograms obtained using the three detection modes highlight the power of multiplexed detection. The main findings from the bioactive profiling include: the Fruit of the Forest tea contains the lowest level of antioxidants and is clearly distinct from the other three teas which are based on Camellia sinensis. The antioxidants detected in the green tea and the two black teas are similar. The green tea contains a higher concentration of the two main antioxidants that eluted at 4.0 and 5.7 min. The simplicity of sample analysis and chemical profiling using RF columns and selective detection was the focus of this study via the analysis of antioxidants in tea using the FRAP reagent. The main advantage of RF-PCD is the ability to split flows for simultaneous detection with minimal post column dead volume contributions, making peak matching between detectors much easier. To date, few studies exploit the power of RF-PCD multiplexed detection to differentiate and identify bioactive compounds in various complex samples. Applications of the approach developed in this study may include antioxidant screening and profiling of natural products, foods and beverages. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan) is a ubiquitous extracellular matrix component, and present at high concentrations in skin, joints and cornea. In the skin, it is synthesized primarily by dermal fibroblasts and by epidermal keratinocytes. Hyaluronic acid usually exists as a high molecular mass (600 000–1 000 000) and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of a disaccharide unit of –3GlcNAc␤1–4GlcA␤1–. Hyaluronic acid has been widely used not only for osteoarthritis and ophthalmology but also for cosmetics for skin care. To examine the biological activities of hyaluronic acid, we have to accurately determine the quantity and molecular masses in biological samples. We review recent development in the analysis of hyaluronic acid having various molecular sizes using electrophoretic and chromatographic techniques. Recently, interactions between hyaluronic acid oligomers and hyaluronic acid-binding proteins have attracted the interest for understanding the biological functions. We show some interesting reports on biological interactions of hyaluronic acid and its oligomers with some proteins.},

  abstract = {The guarantee of wine authenticity arises great concern because of its nutritional and economic importance. Phenolic fingerprints have been used as a source of chemical information for various authentication issues, including botanical and geographical origin, as well as vintage age. The local environment affects wine production and especially its phenolic metabolites. Integrated analytical methodologies combined with chemometrics can be applied in wine fingerprinting studies for the determination and establishment of phenolic markers that contain comprehensive and standardized information about the wine profile and how it can be affected by various environmental factors. This review summarizes all the recent trends in the generation of chemometric models that have been developed for treating chromatographic data and have been used for the investigation of critical wine authenticity issues, revealing phenolic markers responsible for the botanical, geographical, and vintage age classification of wines. Overall, the current review suggests that chromatographic methodologies are promising and powerful techniques that can be used for the accurate determination of phenolic compounds in difficult matrices like wine, highlighting the advantages of the applications of supervised chemometric tools over unsupervised for the construction of prediction models that have been successfully used for the classification based on their territorial and botanical origin.},

  abstract = {This review article compares and contrasts sample preparation techniques coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and describes applications developed in biomedical, forensics, and environmental/industrial hygiene in the last two decades. The proper sample preparation technique can offer valued data for a targeted application when coupled to HPLC and a suitable detector. Improve-ments in sample preparation techniques in the last two decades have resulted in efficient extraction, cleanup, and preconcentration in a single step, thus providing a pathway to tackle complex matrix appli-cations. Applications such as biological therapeutics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, environmen-tal/industrial hygiene, forensics, glycan cleanup, etc., have been significantly enhanced due to improved sample preparation techniques. This review looks at the early sample preparation techniques. Further, it describes eight sample preparation technique coupled to HPLC that has gained prominence in the last two decades. They are (1) solid-phase extraction (SPE), (2) liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), (3) gel perme-ation chromatography (GPC), (4) Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS), (5) solid-phase microextraction (SPME), (6) ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction (UASE), and (7) microwave-assisted sol-vent extraction (MWASE). SPE, LLE, GPC, QuEChERS, and SPME can be used offline and online with HPLC. UASE and MWASE can be used offline with HPLC but have also been combined with the online automated techniques of SPE, LLE, GPC, or QuEChERS for targeted analysis. Three application areas of biomedical, forensics, and environmental/industrial hygiene are reviewed for the eight sample preparation techniques. Three hundred and twenty references on the eight sample preparation techniques published over the last two decades (2001-2021) are provided. Other older references were included to illustrate the historical development of sample preparation techniques. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript the retention and selectivity of a set of linear and non-linear PAHs were evaluated on five different reversed-phase columns. These phases included C18 and C18 Aqua stationary phases, as well as three phenyl phases: Propyl-phenyl, Synergi polar-RP and Cosmosil 5PBB phase. Overall, the results revealed that the phenyl-type columns offered better separation performance for the linear PAHs, while the separation of the structural isomer PAHs was enhanced on the C18 columns. The Propyl-phenyl column was found to have the highest molecular-stationary phase interactions, as evidenced by the greatest rate of change in 'S' (0.71) as a function of the molecular weight in the PAH homologous series, despite having the lowest surface coverage (3\% carbon load) (where S is the slope of a plot of log k versus the solvent composition). In contrast, the C18 Aqua column, having the highest surface coverage (15\% carbon load) was found to have the second lowest molecular-stationary phase interactions (rate of change in S=0.61). Interestingly, the Synergi polar-RP column, which also is a phenyl stationary phase behaved more 'C18-like' than 'phenyl-like' in many of the tests undertaken. This is probably not unexpected since all five phases were reversed phase. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The Propyl-phenyl stationary phase, despite having the lowest surface coverage, was found to exhibit significantly larger enthalpic interactions to the other Phenyl-type phase (Synergi polar-RP) even though this had a much higher surface coverage. This indicated that stronger interactions between the PAHs and the stationary phase ligands were occurring on the Propyl-phenyl phase. Evaluation of the elution band profile of the FAHs in the aqueous methanol mobile phase revealed fairly symmetrical bands for the C18, C18 Aqua and Synergi polar-RP, but severe peak tailing on the Propyl-phenyl phase. A change in mobile phase from methanol to acetonitrile improved the peak shape of the PAHs on the Propyl-phenyl phase, leading to the assumption that unfavourable pi-pi interactions were occurring between the electron-rich PAHs and the electron-rich phenyl rings of the Propyl-phenyl phase.

  abstract = {Enhancement of chromatograms, such as the reduction of baseline noise and baseline drift, is often essential to accurately detect and quantify analytes in a mixture. Current methods have been well studied and adopted for decades and have assisted researchers in obtaining reliable results. However, these methods rely on relatively simple statistics of the data (chromatograms) which in some cases result in significant information loss and inaccuracies. In this study, a deep one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder was developed that simultaneously removes baseline noise and baseline drift with minimal information loss, for a large number and great variety of chromatograms. To enable the autoencoder to denoise a chromatogram to be almost, or completely, noise-free, it was trained on data obtained from an implemented chromatogram simulator that generated 190.000 representative simulated chromatograms. The trained autoencoder was then tested and compared to some of the most widely used and well-established denoising methods on testing datasets of tens of thousands of simulated chromatograms; and then further tested and verified on real chromatograms. The results show that the developed autoencoder can successfully remove baseline noise and baseline drift simultaneously with minimal information loss; outperforming methods like Savitzky-Golay smoothing, Gaussian smoothing and wavelet smoothing for baseline noise reduction (root mean squared error of 1.094~mAU compared to 2.074~mAU, 2.394~mAU and 2.199~mAU) and Savitkzy-Golay smoothing combined with asymmetric least-squares or polynomial fitting for baseline noise and baseline drift reduction (root mean absolute error of 1.171~mAU compared to 3.397~mAU and 4.923~mAU). Evidence is presented that autoencoders can be utilized to enhance and correct chromatograms and consequently improve and alleviate downstream data analysis, with the drawback of needing a carefully implemented simulator, that generates realistic chromatograms, to train the autoencoder.},

  abstract = {1 Introduction Time series are a ubiquitous form of data occurring in virtually every scientific discipline. A common task with time series data is comparing one sequence with another. In some domains a very simple distance measure, such as Euclidean distance will suffice. However, it is often the case that two sequences have the approximately the same overall component shapes, but these shapes do not line up in X-axis. Figure 1 shows this with a simple example. In order to find the similarity between such sequences, or as a preprocessing step before averaging them, we must “warp” the time axis of one (or both) sequences to achieve a better alignment. Dynamic time warping (DTW), is a technique for efficiently achieving this warping. In addition to data mining (Keogh \& Pazzani 2000, Yi et. al. 1998, Berndt \& Clifford 1994), DTW has been used in gesture recognition (Gavrila \& Davis 1995), robotics (Schmill et. al 1999), speech processing (Rabiner \& Juang 1993), manufacturing (Gollmer \& Posten 1995) and medicine (Caiani et. al 1998).},

The grape variety effect explained 8.3\% of the total metabolite variation. Univariate tests showed two-thirds of the metabolites being different between grape varieties. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis based classification models were developed for each grape variety and a panel of classifiers (42 metabolites) was established. All the classification models for grape variety showed a high certainty ({$>$}91\%) for an independent test set. Riesling contained the highest relative concen­ trations of sugars and organic acids, while concentrations of hydroxytyrosol and gallic acid, common antioxi­ dants in wine, decreased in the order of Chardonnay {$>$} Riesling {$>$} Sauvignon Blanc {$>$} Silvaner.},

  abstract = {The instant coffee industry in Kenya has a wide range of product brands and keeping pace with this variety is not an easy task for the ordinary consumer. Most industries have come up with new brands to not only retain consumers but also to attract new ones. Such industries also acknowledge that repeat customers play an important role as such consumers are willing to spend more, purchase frequently, seek for more information, are more resilient to rival‟s promotions and are more likely to spread positive and constructive information about the brand. The instant coffee brand in Kenya has seen a lot of progress and rivalry, with the growth of many producers and coffee brands. The goal of every firm is to be in the lead over their rivals in every phase and dimension of the competition. To attain this, they have to take on strategies to successfully and efficiently achieve brand loyalty within their industry. Active response is expected among firms as a solution to deal with the effects of variation and competition in their environment. This study therefore sought to investigate the influence of pricing, packaging and brand awareness on brand loyalty in instant coffee brands among supermarkets customers within the Nairobi Central Business District (NCBD). The population of study comprised of 10 supermarkets licensed as large retailers operating within the Nairobi Central Business District. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data for this study. The data collected in this study using the questionnaire was prepared for analysis. This study adopted the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software. The study used two statistical tests that is Descriptive Statistics and regression analysis. Descriptive Statistics was used to analyze the background information and to examine the existence of co-relationships between variables. To investigate the effect brand awareness and packaging price had on the brand loyalty of supermarkets customer‟s found in Nairobi Central Business District (NCBD), regression analysis was used. From the study findings, the study concludes that brand awareness, attractive packaging and reasonable pricing positively influence brand loyalty of a product. The study findings revealed that consumers are moved to buy a product when they see advertisement of their preferred brand. The study thus concludes that advertising creates awareness of a product and thus improves the customer loyalty. The study further concludes that availability of different packaging sizes with different prices attracts more attention to consumers compared to a brand that has only one packaging size.},

This occurs because the separation efficiency obtained on PSF columns has been shown in prior studies to be superior to conventional columns, and the flow stream is split radially inside the outlet end fitting of the column, rather than in an axial post-column flow stream split. As a result, the flow through the column can be five times higher than the flow through the MS. In this work, the degradation of amino acids in dilute nitric acid was used to illustrate the process. Separations were obtained in less than 12s, although the reinjection process was initiated 6s after the previous injection. The degradation rate constant of tryptophan, in the presence of tyrosine and phenylalanine, was determined. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

While the conventional UHPLC columns produced more theoretical plates at the optimum flow rate, when separations were performed at maximum through-put the larger particle size AFT column out-performed the UHPLC column. When both the AFT column and the UHPLC column were operated such that they yielded the same number of theoretical plates per separation, the separation on the AFT column was twice as fast as that on the UHPLC column, with the same level of sensitivity and at just 70\% of the back pressure. Furthermore, as the flow velocity further increased the performance gain on the AFT column compared to the UHPLC column improved. An additional advantage of the AFT column was that the flow stream at the exit of the column was split in the radial cross section of the peak profile. This enables the AFT column to be coupled to a flow limiting detector, such as a mass spectrometer. When operated under high through-put conditions separations as fast as six seconds, using mobile phase flow rates in the order of 5-6 mL/min have been recorded. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Data pre-processing was applied to the WPE data by using second-order derivative (SD) followed by correlated optimized warping (COW) in order to align and remove the contributions of the PE film from the spectral data, respectively. The IMF values were correlated with the spectral data using support vector machines regression (SVMR) or partial least squares regression (PLSR) to develop the calibration models. Results based on SVMR applied to the WPE showed high accuracy (R2 = 0.89, RMSEP = 0.37\%, RPD = 3.38) in the prediction. The results indicated that the SD and COW were effective in pre-processing hyperspectral images of PE-packed pork for IMF prediction.

  title = {Detection and Integration of Chromatographic Peaks Using Theoretical Peak Fitting},
  author = {Kuikka, Juho},
  date = {2022},
  abstract = {Peak detection is a fundamental part of chromatography data analysis. In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method development, accurate peak detection is crucial to producing reliable results. Noise in the chromatogram, among other things, can make peak detection challenging. In this Master’s thesis, a literature review of peak detection and integration methods is presented, as well as methods used to estimate noise in the chromatogram signal prior to peak detection. A novel framework for detecting chromatographic peaks that uses theoretical peak shapes is also introduced. The second part of this thesis consists of a case study where the goal is to reduce the relative standard deviation of the integrated peak areas, since this parameter correlates with the method performance. A peak detection and integration framework was developed and applied to data sets produced with the LC/MS method. The framework had a couple of options for estimating noise in the chromatogram data and detecting the start and end points of the peak. The methods for detecting the start and end points of peaks is based on fitting a theoretical peak to the chromatograms. The relative standard deviations obtained with the framework are compared to the relative standard deviations obtained with a known peak detection method from the literature and to the currently used method in the analyzers. The proposed framework performed well compared to the other methods, despite the noise in the data and the varying peak shapes. In most of the analysed data sets, the proposed framework was able to produce lower relative standard deviations of the integrated areas. It was concluded that fitting a theoretical peak improved the precision of the detection and integration of chromatographic peaks.},

As a result of optimization, key parameters of the analytical procedure were established: concentrations of derivatization reagents 1.5. mmol/L and 2.1. mmol/L in methanol for DPPH and ABTS, respectively, and 40\% (v/v) FCR solution in water; reactor temperatures 130 °C for ABTS and FCR and 50 °C in the case of DPPH. In order to validate these procedures, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacities (TEACs) for standard antioxidants obtained by post-column derivatization (on-line) and typical batch colorimetric methods (off-line) were compared; the corresponding measurements were found to be strongly correlated (Pearson coefficient: 0.973, 0.922, 0.853 for DPPH, ABTS and FCR, respectively). The results obtained for standard antioxidants and real fruit sample-aronia extract confirm the applicability of the proposed system to the on-line detection of antioxidants. Its great advantage compared to current routine methods is that it provides both chromatographic profiles and corresponding fingerprints of antioxidants (including unknown ones) along with quantitative determination of antioxidative potential-total, and those exhibited by individual compounds. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Introduction - The wide application of natural and artificial antioxidants in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as well as the recognition of the importance of food antioxidants for supporting human health have created a demand for reliable and industrially applicable methods of determining antioxidative activity. This requirement can be fulfilled with the recently proposed HPLC-post-column derivatisation approach, enabling rapid measurements of antioxidative potential along with profiling antioxidants in complex mixtures. Objective - To employ the commercially available post-column derivatisation device for the on-line detection of antioxidants and to optimise analytical parameters enabling its application for routine profiling of antioxidants in complex mixtures such as those of plant or food origin. Methodology - The mixtures of standards and fruit extracts were resolved using an optimised HPLC method followed by the on-line derivatisation of analytes in a PCX post-column derivatisation instrument. Such parameters as the type of indicator reagent (ABTS, DPPH, Folin-Ciocalteu), its concentration and the temperature of the derivatisation reaction were investigated. The determinations of the Trolox equivalents (TE) values were compared with those obtained by corresponding bulk spectrophotometric tests. Results - The study confirms that the commercial HPLC-coupled post-column derivatisation instruments are suitable for routine on-line detection of antioxidants in complex mixtures and the determination of their TE values. The analytical parameters optimised here appear to represent a ready-to-use toolbox for the food and pharmaceutical industries, enabling the monitoring of bioactive substances along the production line and during storage, and the characterisation of plant material by creating chromatographic profiles supplemented with antioxidant fingerprints. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Metabolomics is an "omics" technique that can support product authentication by providing a chemical fingerprint of a biological system, such as plant and plant-derived products. The main purpose of this article is to verify possible contributions of metabolomic studies to the marketing field, mainly for certified regions, through an integrative review of the literature and maps produced by VOSviewer software. The results indicate that studies based on metabolomics approaches can relate specific food attributes to the region's terroir and know-how. The evidence of this connection, marketing of GIs and metabolomics methods, is viewed as potential tool for marketing purposes (e.g., to assist communication of positive aspects and quality), and legal protection. In addition, our results provide a taxonomic categorization that can guide future marketing research involving metabolomics. Moreover, the results are also useful to government agencies to improve GIs registration systems and promotion strategies.},

  abstract = {The extensive use of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) has resulted in many environmental point and diffuse sources. Identifying the source responsible for a pollution hot spot is vital for assessing remediation measures, however, as there are many possible sources of environmental PFAS pollution, this can be challenging. Chemical fingerprinting has been proposed as an approach to identify contamination sources. Here, concentrations and profiles (relative distribution profiles) of routinely targeted PFAS in freshwater fish from eight sites in Norway, representing three different sources: (1) production of paper products, (2) the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), and (3) long-range atmospheric transport, were investigated. The data were retrieved from published studies. Results showed that fingerprinting of PFAS in fish can be used to identify the dominant exposure source(s), and the profiles associated with the different sources were described in detail. Based on the results, the liver was concluded to be better suited for source tracking compared to muscle. PFAS fingerprints originating from AFFF were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSA). Fingerprints originating from both long-range atmospheric transport and production of paper products were associated with high percentages of long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). However, there were differences between the two latter sources with respect to the n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations and ratios of specific PFCA pairs (PFUnDA/PFDA and PFTrDA/PFDoDA). Low n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations were detected in fish exposed mainly to PFAS via long-range atmospheric transport. In contrast, n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations were high and high percentages of PFOS were detected in fish exposed to pollution from production of paper products. The source-specific fingerprints described here can be used for source tracking.},

  abstract = {Despite their potential carcinogenicity and probable formation during water disinfection processes, little is known about the occurrence of other nitro(so) compounds than a few specific N-nitroso compounds such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). An analytical method was developed to monitor various nitro(so) compounds including N-nitrosamines based on the Griess colorimetric determination of nitrite generated by UV-254~nm photolysis of nitro(so) compounds after separation by HPLC (HPLC-Post Column UV photolysis/Griess reaction (HPLC-PCUV)). To differentiate N-nitro(so) compounds (i.e. UV-labile) from other nitro(so) and N-containing compounds (i.e. UV-resistant), a pre-treatment was established by photolyzing solid-phase extracted samples at 254~nm (1000~mJ/cm2) and thus removing N-nitro(so) compounds selectively. Considering a 1000-fold concentration factor and extraction efficiencies (57–83\%) during solid phase extraction, the method detection limits ranged from 4 to 28~ng/L for dimethylnitramine and eight N-nitrosamines (EPA 8270 nine nitrosamines mixture except for N-nitrosodiphenylamine). For four pool waters, the UV-resistant groups accounted for more than 78\% of the estimated total concentration of nitro(so) and other N-containing compounds (6.1–48.6~nM). Only one unknown UV-labile compound was detected in one pool water (2.0–7.9~nM). NDMA was most frequently detected and N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA) and N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA) were additionally detected in one pool water. Chloramination of a secondary wastewater effluent with NDMA (0.2~nM) and UV-resistant compounds (7.9~nM) from a pilot-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant led to a significant formation of not only unidentified UV-resistant compounds (67.8~nM) and UV-labile compounds (14.6~nM), but also identified nitrosamines such as NDMA (4.3~nM), N-nitrosopiperidine (1.8~nM), NDPA (0.5~nM), and NDBA (0.5~nM). Overall, the novel HPLC-PCUV system is a powerful screening tool for the detection of (un)known N-nitro(so) as well as other nitro(so) and UV-induced nitrite-producing compounds.},

Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS2) has more recently been introduced. This approach allows the distinction between the two forms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and to measure other metabolites. This approach also requires harmonization to curtail the differences between the different analytical methods. To meet this requirement, the American National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the vitamin D Reference laboratory of Ghent University have pooled their expertise to develop a standardization program. This article reviews the main elements and the difficulties of the automated and semi-automated methods for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, from sample preparation to the analytical phase, as well as those related to mass spectrometry. It also emphasizes the need for standardization to better define the clinical decision thresholds of vitamin D nutritional status.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the combination of Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and a novel forecasting algorithm called XGBoost was proposed for food internal quality evaluation. First, the original NIR spectral data was preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay smoothing method to reduce the influence of noises. Secondly, the preprocessed spectra was submitted to PCA to extract essential information. Finally, the model was established by using the XGBoost algorithm. The performance of the proposed model was examined by comparing with different models including back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector regression (SVR). The results showed that the new proposed model outperformed other two models and this XGBoost-based tool was suitable for food internal quality control.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Shiraz is the most widely planted winegrape cultivar in Australia. Sensory studies have indicated that different grapegrowing regions in Australia produce distinct styles of Shiraz wines that differ in flavour characteristics. The current project aimed to characterise the underlying volatile composition associated with regional Shiraz wine styles. Methods and Results: Wines were selected from six geographically distinct regions and the volatile compounds were analysed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive and holistic overview of the wine volatilome. A suite of R language based software enabled feature extraction and importance ranking, following an untargeted metabolomics approach. A classification model based on the random forests algorithm using the 80 most important compounds correctly associated all samples to regions. A range of these compounds, including terpenoids, benzenoids, esters, furan derivatives and aliphatic alcohols, has been associated with grape composition, winemaking influences and the ageing process. Conclusions: The results suggest that the regional compositional differences in varietal wines may be influenced by all processes in the entire wine production chain. Significance of the Study: The current study highlighted the chemical basis underlying the regional typicality of Australian Shiraz wines, and identified specific volatile compounds that may be associated with a region.},

  abstract = {Herbal medicine (HM) has been playing a pivotal role in maintaining human health since ancient times, and its therapeutic theory and clinical experience are the precious traditional medical knowledge reserves. As HM occupies an important position in its own right in global healthcare systems, robust quality assessment and control over its complex chemical composition was of great significance to assure its efficacy and safety. Over the past decades, the concept of HM chemical fingerprints aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of complex chemical matrices has become one of the most convincing tools for the quality assessment of HM. This review summarizes the recent analytical techniques used to generate HM chemical fingerprints, including chromatography, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The advantages, drawbacks, and the application scope of each technology have been scrutinized in an attempt to better understand the data analysis. Furthermore, HM fingerprints together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics methods used for different application domains, such as similarity, exploratory, classification, and regression analysis, have also been discussed and illustrated with a few typical studies. The article provides a general picture and workflow of fingerprinting analyses that have been used for the quality assessment of HM. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the golden age of homogeneous goldcatalyzed reactions, especially those that involve the transformation of highly strained molecules into complex molecular architectures. Gold catalysts, with unique electronic properties and catalytic abilities, have elevated versatile reaction modes through πinteraction induced activation. On the basis of increasing research interest in this topic, together with the significant development of various ligands, including phosphine ligands and azacyclic or noncyclic carbene ligands, the understanding of the catalytic function of gold catalysts has become much deeper and more comprehensive. Different reaction needs thus could be adapted by a novel gold catalyst with a diversified ligand selection. Furthermore, the whole evolution of the gold catalysis on synthetic methodologies has realized and expanded its application into natural product synthesis as well as the potentiality of drug discovery, which endows this ancient metal with a magnificent renaissance. The reactivity of strained small ring molecules with high tension has always been an important research topic in organic chemistry. When the highly strained small ring is linked with a π-electron rich moiety or contains a heteroatom, the gold activation of the π-system or coordination with the heteroatom can initiate a cascade reaction, usually followed by ring opening or expansion. These processes can result in the rapid construction of complex and distinct molecular structures, many of which feature in biologically important molecules. In this review, we will mainly summarize the advances on diverse reaction types and molecular constructions accomplished by homogeneous gold catalysis using highly strained substrates, including methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs), vinylidenecyclopropanes (VDCPs), cyclopropenes as well as aziridine- and epoxide-containing molecules, focusing on the last 10 years. For functionalized alkynyl cyclopropanes, several early inspiring and elegant examples will be described in this review for systematically understanding these transformations.},

An orthogonal projection is first utihzed to obtain the chromatographic profile of the minor analyte. Differentiation of the two-way data matrix in the time direction is subsequently performed to determine the retention time of the chromatographic peak maximum of the major analyte. Based upon these two pieces of information, two approaches for estimating spectra and chromatographic profiles of the pure analytes are developed. A dii approach, which assumes local symmetry in the proximity of the chromatographic peak maximum of the major analyte, and an optimization approach using the estimated peak maximum of the major analyte as objective function.},

The output from a slower chromatographic column is a suitable sample stream. Taking the output from one gas chromatographic column as input to a second column through a thermal modulator then generates a set of high-speed chromatograms. One such secondary chromatogram is generated at each point in the primary chromatogram. When plotted in an appropriate two-dimensional form, this set of high-speed chromatograms becomes a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatogram. A sample first separated by one column is separated a second time by an independent column. All substances in the sample mixture pass through both columns. Two retention time measures characterize each sample substance. Each substance forms a peak on the twodimensional plane at a location determined by the interaction of the substance with the two different stationary phases.},

Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions. Regression trees can fit almost every kind of traditional statistical model, including least-squares, quantile, logistic, Poisson, and proportional hazards models, as well as models for longitudinal and multiresponse data. Greater availability and affordability of software (much of which is free) have played a significant role in helping the techniques gain acceptance and popularity in the broader scientific community.

This review evaluated randomised controlled trials (RCTs), examining the recent literature on the correlations between acute and chronic RW consumption and health. All RCTs published in English on PubMed from 1 January 2000 to 28 February 2023 were evaluated. Ninety-one RCTs were included in this review, seven of which had a duration of more than six months. We assessed the effect of RW on: (1) antioxidant status, (2) cardiovascular function, (3) coagulation pathway and platelet function, (4) endothelial function and arterial stiffness, (5) hypertension, (6) immune function and inflammation status, (7) lipid profile and homocysteine levels, (8) body composition, type 2 diabetes and glucose metabolism, and (9) gut microbiota and the gastrointestinal tract. RW consumption mostly results in improvements in antioxidant status, thrombosis and inflammation markers, lipid profile, and gut microbiota, with conflicting results on hypertension and cardiac function. Notably, beneficial effects were observed on oxidative stress, inflammation, and nephropathy markers, with a modest decrease in CVD risk in five out of seven studies that evaluated the effect of RW consumption. These studies were conducted mainly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and had a duration between six months and two years. Additional long-term RCTs are needed to confirm these benefits, and assess the potential risks associated with RW consumption.},

  abstract = {Single-dose coffee capsule system is a technology used to prepare espresso coffee which offers consumers the possibility to choose among several blends. However, the characterization of espresso coffees extracted with these systems, namely regarding polysaccharides structures and melanoidin content, is scarce. In order to define a carbohydrate and melanoidin composition pattern for single-dose espresso coffee base blends, a range of 6 commercial espresso coffee blends was studied. In addition, a decaffeinated blend and a blend supplemented with plant natural extracts were also included. The base blends showed galactomannans as the predominant polysaccharides over arabinogalactans, on the contrary of the decaffeinated blend. The blend supplemented with natural plant extracts showed glucose-rich polysaccharides. The labelled intensity of coffee single-dose seems to be related with the unknown brown compounds of melanoidins, present in the high molecular weight material of the brews. A pattern could be obtained for single-dose espresso coffee base blends, presenting an average per cup of 1.21g of total solids and 242mg of soluble dietary fibre, constituted by 62mg of galactomannans and 48mg of arabinogalactans, and 123mg of melanoidins. On average, 46\% of espresso coffee low molecular weight compounds are adsorbed to the high molecular weight material, evidencing the importance of the adsorption/desorption phenomena for the properties of coffee dietary fibre.},

  abstract = {Background Alcohol consumption is related to the risk of developing different types of cancer. However, unlike other alcoholic beverages, moderate wine drinking has demonstrated a protective effect on the risk of developing several types of cancer. Objective To analyze the association between wine consumption and the risk of developing cancer. Methods We searched the MEDLINE (through PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird methods. I2 was used to evaluate inconsistency, the τ2 test was used to assess heterogeneity, and The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale were applied to evaluate the risk of bias. This study was previously registered in PROSPERO, with the registration number CRD42022315864. Results Seventy-three studies were included in the systematic review, and 26 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR for the effect of wine consumption on the risk of gynecological cancers was 1.03 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.08), that for colorectal cancer was 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.82, 1.03), and that for renal cancer was 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.81, 1.04). In general, the heterogeneity was substantial. Conclusion The study findings reveal no association between wine consumption and the risk of developing any type of cancer. Moreover, wine drinking demonstrated a protective trend regarding the risk of developing pancreatic, skin, lung, and brain cancer as well as cancer in general.

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the extraction behavior of the main coffee antioxidants (caffeoylquinic acids, melanoidins and caffeine) and the antioxidant capacity, during brewing time in the most widely consumed coffee brew methods (filter and espresso) in coffee. Antioxidant capacity by colorimetric assays (Folin–Ciocalteau, ABTS and DPPH) and electron spin resonance spectroscopy techniques (Fremy's salt and TEMPO) were analyzed. In espresso coffee, more than 70\% of the antioxidants (except dicaffeoylquinic acids, diCQA) of a coffee brew were extracted during the first 8 s. In filter coffee, a U-shape antioxidants extraction profile was observed, starting later (after 75 s) in Vietnam coffee than in Guatemala one, probably due to different wettability. Other technological parameters, such as turbulences and a longer contact time between water and ground coffee in filter coffeemaker, increased extraction efficiency, mainly in less polar antioxidant compounds as diCQA. In conclusion, these technological factors should be considered to optimize coffee antioxidants extraction that can be used as ingredients for functional foods.},

The procedure utilized two different buffer additives as pseudo-stationary phases with different selectivities towards the analytes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) displayed selectivities for the explosives which were similar to C18 reversed-phase HPLC. The negatively charged sulfobutyl ether-b-cyclodextrin (SB-b-CD), sulfated-b-CD and succinylated-b-CD separated the explosives on the formation of inclusion complexes with the analytes, and exhibited different selectivities for the explosives compared to SDS. A mixed pseudo-stationary phase was then formulated by combining 10 mM SB-b-CD, 30 mM SDS and 10\% acetonitrile in 20 mM borate at pH 9 to resolve the two most difficultly separated pairs: 1,3-dinitrobenzene / 1,4-dinitrobenzene and 3-nitrobenzene / 4-nitrobenzene. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

High-quality wines are traditionally produced by ageing them in oak barrels, some special wines also produced by aging on lees, temperature aging method, biological aging, etc. They are very time-consuming and expensive, which seriously affects the production capacity and economic benefits of wineries. In this review, the principles and changing process of oak aging and other traditional aging methods were first discussed. Then, improving the aging effect and the influential factors of modern technologies that can simulate oak aging, such as micro-oxygenation, oak products, and coupling technology, etc., are analyzed. In short, using artificial aging technology to shorten the aging time, improve wine quality and reduce production costs and meet market demand has become an inevitable tendency. However, unclear reaction principles and changing process and unstable quality restrict the commercialization of artificial aging technology. Therefore, we identify future research necessary to further clarify, regulate, and optimize artificial aging technologies that perfectly simulate the traditional barrel maturation environment to truly promote applications in the wine industry.},

  abstract = {As the industry grows, adulteration of many products by mislabelling, re-branding and false advertising is becoming prevalent practice. Existing solutions for analysis often require extensive sample preparation or are limited in terms of detecting different types of integrity issues. We describe a novel authentication method based on Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy which is quantitative, non-invasive and non-destructive. It is sensitive to small deviation in the solid-state chemical structure of a product, which changes the NQR signal properties. These characteristics are unique for different manufacturers, resulting in manufacturer-specific watermarks. We show that nominally identical dietary supplements from different manufacturers can be accurately classified based on features from NQR spectra. Specifically, we use a machine learning-based classification called support vector machines (SVMs) to verify the authenticity of products under test. This approach has been evaluated on three products using semi-custom hardware and shows promising results, with typical classification accuracy of over 95\%.},

Effectively addressing this challenge can be achieved through a reformulation of the problem into information theory, cluster-based supervised classification, and the implementation of key concepts, particularly information entropy and mutual information. These concepts are combined with unsupervised learning atop learned chemical spaces to generate meaningful labels for arbitrary collections of molecules. An open-source and highly extensible codebase is provided to undertake these experiments, demonstrate the viability of the approach on known clusters, and glean insights into the learned representations of chemical space within message-passing neural networks, an architecture not readily permitting interpretability. This approach facilitates the interoperability between human chemical knowledge and the algorithmically derived insights, which will continue to become more prevalent in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Background:               The increasing demand of effective pharmaceutical products directed to fight against malaria lead to the combination of at least two antimalarial drugs. This combination aims to minimize the Plasmodium falciparum resistance which is found when the most frequently used drugs are taken individually. Within this context, proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate which have independent modes of action are taken together to prevent malaria. This paper aims to develop a fast and powerful analytical method for the simultaneous determination of proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate in the commercial Paludrine/Avloclor dosage forms using a multi-way chromatographic calibration based on high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and multivariate curve resolution – alternating leastsquares (MCR-ALS).                                         Methods:               A rapid and powerful analytical method based on HPLC-DAD and MCR-ALS was developed for the simultaneous quantification of proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate in the commercial Paludrine/Avloclor antimalarial drugs. An isocratic mobile phase composed by 0.2 M ammonium acetate, acetonitrile, and methanol (40:25:35) and a flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1 were employed in the chromatographic runs with an elution time about 5 min.                                         Results:               This approach demonstrates that chromatographic analysis may become considerably simpler and economical in terms of time, cost, and organic solvent consumption when coupled to multiway calibration models such as MCR-ALS. In fact, this multi-way chromatographic calibration based on second-order HPLC-DAD data matrices (with extremely low chromatographic resolution) and MCR-ALS allows the development of greener analytical methods for complex samples. The proposed analytical method allowed the simultaneous quantification of two antimalarial APIs present in the commercial Paludrine/Avloclor drugs with low REP values below 8\% for the simultaneous determination of proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate.                                         Conclusion:               The proposed multi-way chromatographic strategy can be used for routine control of pharmaceutical dosage forms. It should be highlighted that MCR-ALS allowed to: (a) achieve the second- order advantage and the quantification of analytes in the presence of uncalibrated compounds such as coeluted profile measured in different magnitude of the signal in each successive chromatographic run and significant overlapping profiles and (b) separate the contribution of several components from chromatographic runs with extremely low separation of peaks through the deconvolution of the signal obtained, performing the so-called mathematical chromatography.},

In this approach, acidic potassium permanganate can react with readily oxidisable compounds (potential antioxidants), post-column, to produce chemiluminescence. Using flow injection analysis, experimental parameters that afforded the most suitable permanganate chemiluminescence signal for a range of known antioxidants were studied in a univariate approach. Optimum conditions were found to be: 1 x 10(-3) M potassium permanganate solution containing 1\% (w/v) sodium polyphosphates adjusted to pH 2 with sulphuric acid, delivered at a flow rate of 2.5 mL min(-1) per line. Further investigations showed some differences in detection selectivity between HPLC with the optimised post-column permanganate chemiluminescence detection and DPPH center dot and ABTS assays towards antioxidant standards. However, permanganate chemiluminescence detection was more sensitive. Moreover, screening for antioxidants in green tea, cranberry juice and thyme using potassium permanganate chemiluminescence offers several advantages over the traditional DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot+) assays, such as faster reagent preparation and superior stability; simpler post-column reaction manifold; and greater compatibility with fast chromatographic separations using monolithic columns.

  abstract = {In recent years, food frauds and adulterations have increased significantly. This practice is motivated by fast economical gains and has an enormous impact on public health, representing an important issue in food science. In this context, this review has been designed to be a useful guide of potential biomarkers of food authenticity and safety. In terms of food authenticity, we focused our attention on biomarkers reported to specify different botanical or geographical origins, genetic diversity or production systems, while at the food safety level, molecular evidences of food adulteration or spoilage will be highlighted. This report is the first to combine results from recent studies in a format that allows a ready overview of metabolites ({$<$} 1200 Da) and potentially molecular routes to monitor food authentication and safety. This review has therefore the potential to unveil important aspects in food adulteration and safety, contributing to improve the current regulatory frameworks.},

  abstract = {Plagiarism is unauthorized appropriation of other people’s ideas, processes or text without giving correct credit and with intention to present it as own property. Appropriation of own published ideas or text and passing it as original is denominated self-plagiarism and considered as bad as plagiarism. The frequency of plagiarism is increasing and development of information and communication technologies facilitates it, but simultaneously, thanks to the same technology, plagiarism detection software is developing[1]. Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders are punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity[2]. When we talking about self-plagiarism avid B. Resnik clarifies, “Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft[3].” Roig (2002)[4] offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: ~ • - duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; • - partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; • - text recycling; and • - copyright infringement. ~ In cases of proven plagiarism and academic self-plagiarism consequences may include[5]: ~ • - The author is obliged to withdraw the disputable manuscript which is already published or in different pre-publication stages. • - In the event of co-authorship, the co-author must approve of publication withdrawal, even if the misconduct is not related to them. • - Publications proved to be false by the Commission are erased from author’s bibliography or marked appropriately. • - The procedure for detraction from academic degrees (MSc or PhD) at the University is initiated if obtained based on false thesis or dissertation. • - The procedure for detraction from scientific and educational titles is initiated by a relevant body if based on false publications or other inappropriate way. • - Scientific institutions, organizations and other relevant institutions are informed, especially those financing scientific projects, about scientific misconduct if they are directly related or in the event that the incriminated scientist works in a leading position or as a member of any decision-making body. ~ Withdrawal of scientific articles published in journals is becoming more common. Similar experiences recorded by one blog, Retraction Watch[6], which a year and a half follows the withdrawal of articles and consequences for the authors of these articles: from the prohibition of the publication to the dismissal from work.},

  abstract = {Coffea arabica L. belongs to the Rubiaceae family, and the genus Coffea is believed to have a primary center of origin and genetic variability in the highlands of southwestern Ethiopia. It is a vital beverage commodity across the world and a valuable export product, ranking second in international trade after petroleum. Ethiopia is among the top five major coffee-producing countries and is Africa’s leading producer. However, its full production capacity has not yet been exploited, and research efforts to reduce biotic and abiotic factors through reproduction have been extremely limited. Hence, improvement through different breeding methods is essential to overcome the constraints in its production. Thus, the objective of this study is to review the different breeding methods applied for different traits in Ethiopia. Breeding methods depend on the type and the source of traits and the final breeding objectives. The main breeding objectives are production, resistance/tolerance to diseases, and cup quality. The commonly applied breeding methods are selected and intra-specific hybridization, germplasm enhancement, and the development of improved varieties with wider adaptability. There is also a practice of crossing parental lines selected for certain desirable traits for the development of hybrid varieties. Accordingly, some promising success has been obtained. Forty-one coffee varieties have been released so far. Because conventional breeding methods are time-consuming, integrating conventional breeding methods with biotechnological techniques could have an instrumental role in the rapid development of suitable varieties for the changing climate.},

We have overcome the calibration problem using absolute detectors, ligh!t!separation? scattering and viscometer, on-line to the SEC system that do not need of calibration. Shear degradation, concentration effects, viscous fingering, poor column resolution, and in general, low reproducibility are the main difficulties in SEC fractionation. A successful characterization of UHMM HA polymers requires an optimization of the experimental protocol. Each step of the experimental protocol should be performed methodically to obtain reliable results. Commercially available SEC aqueous columns have not optimized for UHMM polymers. Using an optimized SEC system shear degradation and non-ideal SEC fractionation can occur when Mw of the HA sample is approximately higher than three million. Also the dispersity index could be underestimated. q 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

UV detection was accomplished at 260 nm using DAD. The developed methods were validated using ICH guidelines and were successfully applied to the determination of the ternary mixture in their pharmaceutical formulation in the Australian market with acceptable percent recoveries. Results obtained by the proposed methods were statistically compared to those of the reported methods regarding the mean percent recoveries and variances showing no significant difference.

In order to maximize profits, some producers may add lower cost materials (such as corn, barley, or even coffee husks) to commercial coffee. In view of the growing market for coffee products and the importance of coffee for the Brazilian economy, it is necessary to have a rapid, simple, and reliable methodology to identify and quantify coffee adulterants. NMR has proved to be a versatile and robust tool for the identification of adulterants in foods and beverages. Here, we explore the versatility of 1H NMR assisted with chemometric tools, avoiding laborious data analysis, for the quantification of coffee adulteration. Six different adulterants were considered: barley, corn, coffee husks, soybean, rice, and wheat. The NMR-based methodology described here provided satisfactory LOD values (0.31–0.86\%) for adul- terants in medium and dark roast coffees. The statistical techniques PCA and SIMCA were employed for pattern recognition and the identification of pure and adulterated samples. Use of the SIMCA model enabled 100\% correct classification for both training and prediction sets, ensuring the accuracy, traceability, and reliability of the results.},

  abstract = {Quantification of the many constituents that make up our food, whether they are desirable (vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients) or undesirable (pesticides, toxins), is one of the most practical applications of chemistry. In this study, kombucha, a popular fermented tea beverage, was analyzed using acid–base titration and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Kombucha is made via the fermentation of sweetened black tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), which produces acetic acid in addition to a variety of other organic acids and vitamins. The aim of this study was to analyze the acid content of kombucha over a 21-day fermentation period in order to characterize the fermentation kinetics. Titrimetric analysis revealed that the total acidity increased linearly with fermentation time at a rate of 1.5 mM/day. The acetic acid content was also quantified by HPLC at 7-day intervals by standard addition and compared to the total acidity determined by titration. A paired Student’s t test was used to validate the methods. In an extension of the lab, HPLC was also used to identify and quantify the caffeine content of kombucha. The experiments utilized in this study provide a means to characterize beverages and fermentation as well as teach important quantitative and statistical skills. This study was implemented as a three-week teaching lab in a quantitative analysis course for undergraduate chemistry majors.},

The assays were based on (i) the colour change associated with reduction of the 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH center dot): and (ii) the emission of light (chemiluminescence) upon reaction with acidic potassium permanganate. Results from the two approaches were similar and reflected the complex array of antioxidant species present in the samples. However, some differences in selectivity were observed. Chromatograms generated with the chemiluminescence assay contained more peaks, which was ascribed to the greater sensitivity of the reagent towards minor, readily oxidisable sample components. The three coffee samples produced closely related profiles, signifying their fundamentally similar chemical compositions and origin. Nevertheless, the overall intensity and complexity of the samples in both UV absorption and antioxidant assay chromatograms were aligned with the manufacturers description of flavour intensity and character.

Although all tested systems were correlated to some degree to the C18 dimension, regional measurement of separation divergence revealed that performance of specific systems was better for certain sample components.

  abstract = {Chitosan is a biopolymer of increasing significance, as well as a renewable and sustainable material. Its main molecular characteristics are molar mass and degree of acetylation (composition). Precise average degrees of acetylation were measured by quantitative 1H solution-state NMR spectroscopy. While number-average degrees of acetylation had already been determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, weight-average degrees of acetylation are also determined and may be more relevant for some properties, such as mechanical properties. We report the first separation of chitosan according to its degree of acetylation using free solution capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis separates chitosan in the ‘critical conditions’: the molar mass plays little role and the separation is by the degree of acetylation. It characterises the heterogeneity of chitosan samples in terms of composition (dispersity of the distribution of degrees of acetylation). This heterogeneity (broad distribution of degrees of acetylation) cannot be neglected contrary to a common assumption found in the literature. This fast and easy separation will allow establishing a structure–property relationships.},

Also, optimization is restricted by requirements such as the modulation criterion and upper temperature limits of the individual columns. In general, the internal diameter of the primary column is larger than the internal diameter of the secondary column which complicates the optimization and leads to sub-optimal flow settings, column loadability issues and indirectly a reduction of the overall separation efficiency. In this review, papers concerning method development for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) are discussed and general guidelines are proposed with the focus on selecting the GC × GC instrumental set-up and column-set and optimization of the GC × GC settings.},

  abstract = {In this work, different chemometric tools were compared to classify n = 26 conventional (CONV) and n = 19 organic (ORG) coffees from the main Brazilian producing regions based on the chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and antioxidant activity. Principal component analysis separated ORG and CONV coffees but the distinction among the producing regions of Brazilian coffee was not possible. Partial least squares discriminant analysis classified all ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation. Similarly, linear discriminant analysis was able to discriminate 100\% and 81\% of ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation, respectively, in which total phenolic content (TPC), ferric reducing antioxidant activity, and caffeic acid were the main discriminant variables. Overall 100\% of samples from Paraná, Minas Gerais, and blended samples were correctly classified, where TPC, flavonoids, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, caffeic acid, pH, and soluble solids were the main discriminant variables. Support vector machines classified 95\% ORG and 88\% CONV, 100\% Coffea arabica, and 88\% and 78\% coffees produced in São Paulo and Minas Gerais. k-Nearest neighbors was effective in distinguishing 100\% CONV, 89\% ORG, 100\% coffees from São Paulo, and 100\% C. arabica coffees. Overall, HPLC data and simple physicochemical parameters allied to chemometrics were effective in authenticating the cultivation system and the botanical origin of Brazilian coffees. Practical Application Coffee adulteration is a serious problem in the food chain as some fraudsters replace coffee powder by other cheaper products. In the case of organic coffee, this scenario is even worse as still there is not a universal method to differentiate conventionally grown coffee from its organic counterpart. In addition, Brazilian coffee is produced in different regions and the commercial value varies. Therefore, we analyzed some physicochemical, chemical, and antioxidant properties of Brazilian coffees from distinct origins and classified the samples using chemometrics. Our approach seems to be interesting for quality control purposes.},

While the problem is particularly acute in the biomedical literature because of the life-threatening implications when treatment recommendations and decisions are based on false science, it is relevant for any knowledge domain, including the social sciences, law, and education. Yet current practices for handling retractions are seen as inadequate. We use the metaphor of a virus to illustrate how such studies can spread and contaminate the knowledge system, when they continue to be treated as valid. We suggest drawing from public health models designed to prevent the spread of biological viruses and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the current governance model of professional self-regulation with a proposed public health governace model. The paper concludes by considering the value of adding a triple-helix model that brings industry into the university-state governance mechanisms and incorporates bibliometric capabilities needed for a holistic treatment of the retraction process.},

Using an internal standard corrects for the loss of analyte during sample preparation and analysis provided that it is selected appropriately. After the best regression model is selected, the analytical method needs to be validated using quality control (QC) samples prepared and stored in the same temperature as intended for the study samples. Most of the international guidelines require that the parameters, including linearity, specificity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), matrix effect and stability, be assessed during validation.

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to the most common form of dementia in elderly people. Modifiable dietary and lifestyle factors could either accelerate or ameliorate the aging process and the risk of developing AD and other age-related morbidities. Emerging evidence also reports a potential link between oral and gut microbiota alterations and AD. Dietary polyphenols, in particular wine polyphenols, are a major diver of oral and gut microbiota composition and function. Consequently, wine polyphenols health effects, mediated as a function of the individual’s oral and gut microbiome are considered one of the recent greatest challenges in the field of neurodegenerative diseases as a promising strategy to prevent or slow down AD progression. This review highlights current knowledge on the link of oral and intestinal microbiome and the interaction between wine polyphenols and microbiota in the context of AD. Furthermore, the extent to which mechanisms bacteria and polyphenols and its microbial metabolites exert their action on communication pathways between the brain and the microbiota, as well as the impact of the molecular mediators to these interactions on AD patients, are described.},

Thus, education in scientific writing in chemistry cannot focus on writing alone, but such efforts must aim both at the development of higher level skills in reading and writing; moreover, the reading instruction ought to occur concurrently with or precede the writing exercise. In this context, a computer laboratory experiment is described which develops students’ ability to read spectra. The computer laboratory experiment cultivates students’ Excel skills with the specific objective of teaching them how individual transitions overlap in spectra. Qualitative decomposition and an automated Solver extension method are discussed. Qualitative decomposition is best suited to develop students’ understanding of overlapping transitions and spectra and to advance their conceptual knowledge. Learning to use Solver is a valuable additional skill, but the automated process is no substitute for the learning experience provided by the qualitative decomposition.},

The present paper is a critical presentation of the most important tests used to determine the antioxidant activity, detection mechanism, applicability, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Out of the tests based on the transfer of a hydrogen atom, the following were presented: the Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity (ORAC) test, the Hydroxyl Radical Antioxidant Capacity (HORAC) test, the Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP) test, and the Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) test. The tests based on the transfer of one electron include the Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Power (CUPRAC) test, the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) test, the Folin–Ciocalteu test. Mixed tests, including the transfer of both a hydrogen atom and an electron, include the 2,2′-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) test, and the [2,2-di(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1-picrylhydrazyl] (DPPH) test. All these assays are based on chemical reactions and assessing the kinetics or reaching the equilibrium state relies on spectrophotometry, presupposing the occurrence of characteristic colours or the discolouration of the solutions to be analysed, which are processes monitored by specific wavelength adsorption. These assays were successfully applied in antioxidant analysis or the determination of the antioxidant capacity of complex samples. As a complementary method in such studies, one may use methods based on electrochemical (bio)sensors, requiring stages of calibration and validation. The use of chemical methods together with electrochemical methods may result in clarification of the operating mechanisms and kinetics of the processes involving several antioxidants.},

  abstract = {In chemistry-related fields, graph-based machine learning has received significant attention as atoms and their chemical bonds in a molecule can be represented as a mathematical graph. However, many molecular properties are sensitive to changes in the molecular structure. For this reason, molecules have a mixed distribution for their molecular properties in molecular space, and it consequently makes molecular machine learning difficult. However, this problem has not been investigated in either chemistry or computer science. To tackle this problem, we propose a robust and machine-guided molecular representation based on deep metric learning (DML), which automatically generates an optimal representation for a given dataset. To this end, we first adopt DML for molecular machine learning by integrating it with graph neural networks (GNNs) and devising a new objective function for representation learning. In experimental evaluations, machine learning algorithms with the proposed method achieved better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art GNNs. Furthermore, the proposed method was also effective on extremely small datasets, and this result is impressive because many real world applications suffer from a lack of training data.},

Despite the existence of various algorithms able to focus on this rank evaluation, the method very often used for this task is finally quite simple since it is based on the observation of the eigenvalues generated by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Although this method has shown some potential for rank evaluation, it is still difficult to use it on complex and big datasets or when the signal to noise ratio is relatively weak. In this paper, we introduce a new method, based on the SIMPLE-to-use Self-modeling Mixture Analysis (SIMPLISMA) algorithm that we call Randomised SIMPLISMA. The main idea is thus to use random selections of spectra from the initial dataset and to apply the SIMPLISMA approach to each of them. At the end of this step, all selected spectra are observed using PCA where observed clusters can potentially be highlighted and exploited for the tasks we are interested in. With the present paper, we want to highlight in particular the possibility of an easier rank estimation and initial estimates generation when this approach is considered. Datasets of different complexity acquired with various spectroscopic techniques will be explored in order to evaluate the potential of this approach.},

The fruits were: cherry, raspberry, peach, apricot, grape, plum, orange and apple. Antioxidant activity, total polyphenols and flavonoids content were considerably higher in most of the fruit beers in respect to conventional, no-fruit beers. Cherries beers exhibit the highest values, followed by grape, plum and orange beers. An enrichment was observed in catechin and quercetin content in all fruit beers examined. Myricetin and resveratrol were also detected in most of the fruit beers. Among phenolic acids, an enrichment in chlorogenic, neochlorogenic, p-coumaric and caffeic acids was measured in most of the fruit beers in respect to conventional beers. Our findings show that fruits addition during the fermentation process considerably increased the antioxidant activity of beer and qualitatively and quantitatively improved its phenolics profile.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many machine learning techniques have been proposed in the last few years to process data represented in graph-structured form. Graphs can be used to model several scenarios, from molecules and materials to RNA secondary structures. Several kernel functions have been defined on graphs that coupled with kernelized learning algorithms, have shown state-of-the-art performances on many tasks. Recently, several definitions of Neural Networks for Graph (GNNs) have been proposed, but their accuracy is not yet satisfying. In this paper, we propose a task-independent pre-training methodology that allows a GNN to learn the representation induced by state-of-the-art graph kernels. Then, the supervised learning phase will fine-tune this representation for the task at hand. The proposed technique is agnostic on the adopted GNN architecture and kernel function, and shows consistent improvements in the predictive performance of GNNs in our preliminary experimental results. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

These online communities allowed individuals to communicate across the globe, gravitating toward people like them or those who shared similar beliefs. Conversations around vaccinations have been particularly polarizing across social media even though scientific literature continually validates their safety and effectiveness. This study will explore whether online public discourse about vaccinations changes before and after major scientific publications, and will measure what is related to social engagement around vaccinations on Twitter. In September 2018, two weeks’ worth of Twitter posts (n = 2,919) discussing vaccinations were collected, coded, and analyzed before and after two major 2014 scientific publications. Linear regression analyses examined variables related to engagement with vaccination-related Tweets pre- and postpublication. Antivaccine-related Tweets decreased by over 25\% after scientific publications, while provaccine Tweets increased by 16.6\%. Regression models suggest verification status and number of followers were the strongest predictors of Twitter engagement. Findings indicate that scientific publications might affect what people public health information people share online, and how people engage with online content. In a time when false information is easily spread online, this study suggests the need for continual scientific publication on “hot topics,” and urges researchers to partner with influential individuals on social media to disseminate effective, evidence-based, and user-friendly public health information to the public.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present work was to make a quantitative and critical comparison of a number of drift and noise-removal algorithms, which were proven useful by other researchers, but which had never been compared on an equal basis. To make a rigorous and fair comparison, a data generation tool is developed in this work, which utilizes a library of experimental backgrounds, as well as peak shapes obtained from curve fitting on experimental data. Several different distribution functions are used, such as the log-normal, bi-Gaussian, exponentially convoluted Gaussian, exponentially modified Gaussian and modified Pearson VII distributions. The tool was used to create a set of hybrid (part experimental, part simulated) data, in which the background and all peak profiles and areas are known. This large data set (500 chromatograms) was analysed using seven different drift-correction and five different noise-removal algorithms (35 combinations). Root-mean square errors and absolute errors in peak area were determined and it was shown that in most cases the combination of sparsity-assisted signal smoothing and asymmetrically reweighted penalized least-squares resulted in the smallest errors for relatively low-noise signals. However, for noisier signals the combination of sparsity-assisted signal smoothing and a local minimum value approach to background correction resulted in lower absolute errors in peak area. The performance of correction algorithms was studied as a function of the density and coverage of peaks in the chromatogram, shape of the background signal, and noise levels. The developed data-generation tool is published along with this article, so as to allow similar studies with other simulated data sets and possibly other algorithms. The rigorous assessment of correction algorithms in this work may facilitate further automation of data-analysis workflows.},

A convex optimization problem is formulated so as to encapsulate these non-parametric models. To account for the positivity of chromatogram peaks, an asymmetric penalty function is utilized. A robust, computationally efficient, iterative algorithm is developed that is guaranteed to converge to the unique optimal solution. The approach, termed Baseline Estimation And Denoising with Sparsity (BEADS), is evaluated and compared with two state-of-the-art methods using both simulated and real chromatogram data.},

In addition, a total of 15 isoflavones were simultaneously determined in one single HPLC run with photodiode array detection (DAD), 8 of which were quantified in Radix Puerariae for the first time. Content determination results were used to comprehensively evaluate qualities of Radix Puerariae samples from different natural habitats in China. A YMC™ C18 column (150mm×4.6mm i.d.; 5μm particle size) and gradient elution (acetonitrile and water with 0.02\% (v/v) of formic acid) were used during the analysis. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r{$>$}0.9996) within the test ranges. The intra-day and inter-day stability for 15 analytes were less than 1.32\% and 1.87\%, respectively. The recoveries were between 95.1\% and 103.5\%. The established method was simple, feasible and practical, and could be applied to routine analysis of Radix Puerariae and its preparation.

  abstract = {This is a historical account on the development of capillary LC from its beginning to the present day. The first investigations into the viability of capillary LC date back to the late 1970s, a decade after the pioneering efforts in HPLC. The drastically reduced column dimensions were required to counter the slow solute diffusion in liquids. There were numerous instrumental difficulties with sample introduction and detection in the picoliter or even femtoliter volumes. High-efficiency separations were needed in the analysis of complex biological mixtures. Miniaturization brought distinct advantages in spectroscopic and electrochemical detection. Since the 1980s, column technologies underwent significant changes: (a) from glass-drawn microcapillaries to slurry-packed, small-diameter fused silica columns; and (b) in microcapillaries packed alternatively with sub-2-mu m particles or monoliths. The viability of LC-MS combination has dramatically promoted the use of small-diameter capillaries. Through "omics technologies", capillary LC/tandem MS accounts for most applications in proteomics, glycomics and metabolomics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Besides, the proposed methodologies resulted to be excellent to detect and quantify fraud levels in coffee and decaf coffee samples adulterated with chicory by using partial least squares (PLS) regression, exhibiting good calibration linearities, calibration errors, and prediction errors. In this case, improved capabilities were observed with HPLC-FLD fingerprints, providing better PLS calibration linearities (R2~{$>~$}0.999), lower calibration errors (≤0.8\%), and similar to better prediction errors (2.9–3.2\%) in comparison to HPLC-UV fingerprints.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Coffee is one of the most popular beverages around the world, consumed as an infusion of ground roasting coffee beans with a characteristic taste and flavor. Two main varieties, Arabica and Robusta, are produced worldwide. Furthermore, interest of consumers in quality attributes related to coffee production region and varieties is increasing. Thus, it is necessary to encourage the development of simple methodologies to authenticate and guarantee the coffee origin, variety and roasting degree, aiming to prevent fraudulent practices. RESULTS C18 high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) fingerprints obtained after brewing coffees without any sample treatment other than filtration (i.e. considerably reducing sample manipulation) were employed as sample chemical descriptors for subsequent coffee characterization and classification by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA showed good classification capabilities regarding coffee origin, variety and roasting degree when employing HPLC-FLD fingerprints, although overlapping occurred for some sample groups. However, the discrimination power increased when selecting HPLC-FLD fingerprinting segments richer in discriminant features, which were deduced from PLS-DA loading plots. In this case, excellent separation was observed and 100\% classification rates for both PLS-DA calibrations and predictions were obtained (all samples were correctly classified within their corresponding groups). CONCLUSION HPLC-FLD fingerprinting segments were3 found to be suitable chemical descriptors for discriminating the origin (country of production), variety (Arabica and Robusta) and roasting degree of coffee. Therefore, HPLC-FLD fingerprinting can be proposed as a feasible, simple and cheap methodology to address coffee authentication, especially for developing coffee production countries. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

Untargeted high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection (HPLC-UV-FLD) fingerprinting strategies in combination with chemometrics were employed for the authenticity assessment and fraud quantitation of adulterated coffees involving three different and common adulterants: chicory, barley, and flours. The methodologies were applied after a solid–liquid extraction procedure with a methanol:water 50:50 (v/v) solution as extracting solvent. Chromatographic fingerprints were obtained using a Kinetex® C18 reversed-phase column under gradient elution conditions using 0.1\% formic acid aqueous solution and methanol as mobile phase components. The obtained coffee and adulterants extract HPLC-UV-FLD fingerprints were evaluated by partial least squares regression-discriminants analysis (PLS-DA) resulting to be excellent chemical descriptors for sample discrimination. One hundred percent classification rates for both PLS-DA calibration and prediction models were obtained. In addition, Arabica and Robusta coffee samples were adulterated with chicory, barley, and flours, and the obtained HPLC-UV-FLD fingerprints subjected to partial least squares (PLS) regression, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodologies to assess coffee authenticity and to quantify adulteration levels (down to 15\%), showing both calibration and prediction errors below 1.3\% and 2.4\%, respectively.},

For that purpose, different adulteration cases, involving both coffee production region and variety, were evaluated by pairs (Colombia-Ethiopia, Colombia-Nicaragua, India-Indonesia, Vietnam Arabica-Vietnam Robusta, Vietnam Arabica-Cambodia, and Vietnam Robusta-Cambodia adulteration cases). Overall, the proposed non-targeted HPLC-FLD fingerprinting strategy showed very good results with PLS cross-validation and prediction errors below 3.4\% and 7.5\%, respectively, for adulteration levels below 15\%.

  abstract = {Several epidemiological studies and clinical trials have reported the beneficial effects of green tea, coffee, wine, and curry on human health, with its anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and neuroprotective properties. These effects, which have been supported using cell-based and animal studies, are mainly attributed to epigallocatechin gallate found in green tea, chlorogenic acid in coffee, resveratrol in wine, and curcumin in curry. Polyphenols are proposed to function via various mechanisms, the most important of which is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These polyphenols exert conflicting dual actions as anti- and pro-oxidants. Their anti-oxidative actions help scavenge ROS and downregulate nuclear factor-κB to produce favorable anti-inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, pro-oxidant actions appear to promote ROS generation leading to the activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which modulates different enzymes and factors with health beneficial roles. Currently, it remains unclear how these polyphenols exert either pro- or anti-oxidant effects. Similarly, several human studies showed no beneficial effects of these foods, and, by extension polyphenols, on obesity. These inconsistencies may be attributed to different confounding study factors. Thus, this review provides a state-of-the-art update on these foods and their principal polyphenol components, with an assumption that it prevents obesity.},

  abstract = {Retention time is an important parameter for identification in untargeted LC-MS screening. Precise retention time prediction facilitates the annotation process and is well known for proteomics. However, the lack of available experimental information for a long time has limited the prediction accuracy for small molecules. Recently introduced large databases for small-molecule retention times make possible reliable machine learning–based predictions for the whole diversity of compounds. Applying simple projections may expand these predictions on various LC systems and conditions. In our work, we describe a complex approach to predict retention times for nano-HPLC that includes the consequent deployment of binary and regression gradient boosting models trained on the METLIN small-molecule dataset and simple projection of the results with a small number of easily available compounds onto nano-HPLC separations. The proposed model outperforms previous attempts to use machine learning for predictions with a 46-s mean absolute error. The overall performance after transfer to nano-LC conditions is less than 155 s (10.8\%) in terms of the median absolute (relative) error. To illustrate the applicability of the described approach, we successfully managed to eliminate averagely 25 to 42\% of false-positives with a filter threshold derived from ROC curves. Thus, the proposed approach should be used in addition to other well-established in silico methods and their integration may broaden the range of correctly identified molecules.},

Here, aroma compounds in whiskey samples (n = 11) were extracted using ultrasound-assisted DLLME with chloroform (as extraction solvent). The chloroform extract was analyzed by GC/MS with data manipulation by AMDIS (automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system) to allow for comparisons between whiskey samples. Aroma compounds commonly reported in the literature (furfural, isoamyl acetate, 5-methyl furfural, ethyl esters, phenylethyl alcohol, whiskeylactone, and vanillin) were tentatively identified based upon the match to the MS library. This unique laboratory allows students to engage in a real-world analysis of a high-value product and to explore the use of AMDIS to tentatively identify compounds and compare chromatographic profiles of various whiskey samples for identification of common and unique constituents. Students also use the literature to provide sensory information for these identified semivolatile compounds.}

The CUPRAC (CUPric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity) method of antioxidant measurement, introduced by our research group, is based on the absorbance measurement of Cu(I)-neocuproine (Nc) chelate formed as a result of the redox reaction of chain-breaking antioxidants with the CUPRAC reagent, Cu(II)-Nc, where absorbance is recorded at the maximal light-absorption wavelength of 450nm.

  abstract = {In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the field of education to swiftly redesign courses for hybrid and online teaching environments. The lack of in-person learning prompted professionals to rapidly incorporate unique and previously never-seen teaching practices in numerous different fields. One of the biggest challenges that educators have been facing during these difficult times is the lack of hands-on technology-based teaching activites under hybrid and online environments. To mitigate this issue, a small, affordable, and 3D-printed visible spectrophotometer (SpectroBox) was developed to allow instructors to rapidly create a portable instrument and provide a hands-on learning experience for students. SpectroBox is mainly a do-it-yourself at-home platform specifically designed for rapid implementation; thus, instructors can deploy SpectroBox under various learning environments, such as remote and hybrid practices. Included parts are in a small package and are transportable via standard parcel delivery; consequently, students can get access to these spectrometric units rapidly and easily. In this work, detailed design, schematics, and step-by-step instructions are presented for instructors to easily incorporate this system. The SpectroBox project was implemented and tested during the Fall 2020 semester, and student assessment data indicated that the theoretical and practical aspects of visible spectroscopy were better understood by 67\% of students with this hands-on learning exercise. The final learning outcome of this project was a broad skillset possessed by students, including 3D printable object design, spectrometer assembly, principles of optical spectroscopy, exploration of design components, basic electronics, data acquisition and processing. SpectroBox helped students to fully understand the fundamentals of visible spectroscopy and ultimately improved their expertise in the field of spectroscopy.},

These reactions are limited when sulfur dioxide (SO2) is used as wine preservative, as SO2 plays an important role in reducing quinones back to their phenol form. In no sulfite-added wine, oxidation chemistry undoubtedly results changed. Therefore, in this work, the phenolic profile of a white wine without adding sulfites, after twelve-month storage, was investigated by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and compared to a control stored with sulfur dioxide. A total of twenty-six phenolics were detected including hydroxycinnamate derivatives and minor compounds resulting from oxidation processes, i.e. oxidized caffeic acid dimers, whose structures were tentatively proposed on the basis of their UV, MS, and MS/MS typical fragmentation. The experimental evidence of these latter is described for the first time in wine stored without added sulfites, and it may contribute to get new insight in the field of wine oxidation processes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Due to the current dominance of a few grape varieties in the wine market, the aim of this work was to study the detailed phenolic and volatile composition, chromatic characteristics, and sensorial properties of red wines elaborated with new Vitis vinifera grapes (Moribel and Tinto Fragoso) identified using the High Perfomance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector-Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS), Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), CIELab color space, and Napping ® techniques. RESULTS Tinto Fragoso wine showed higher phenolic content than Moribel, with more anthocyanins, flavonols, and stilbenes. These wines also contained anthocyanin diglucosides not reported for Vitis vinifera wines. The odor activity values of free volatile compounds were calculated to indicate their influence on wine aroma, the fruity aromas of Moribel standing out particularly. The wines studied were positively evaluated by the tasters. Moribel's sensory profile was characterized by red fruit aromas and Tinto Fragoso showed more aromatic intensity and persistence in the mouth. CONCLUSION The results obtained from the first characterization of red wines made from novel Vitis vinifera grapes suggest that Moribel and Tinto Fragoso could be appropriate raw materials for the elaboration of quality young red wines. Tinto Fragoso provided wines with sensorial properties different from those of Tempranillo, and could be an alternative to the well known red wines on the market. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

This communication discusses strengths and weaknesses of both exercises. First, students generated absorbance data using an Excel spreadsheet, but they were overwhelmingly put off by simulated noise in their absorbance values. Second, students simulated running an HPLC using a Jupyter notebook and designed a method to separate three components of Excedrin. Students reported that the simulation helped them to understand HPLC and suggested that the online activity be used as a supplement when face-to-face laboratory instruction resumes. The main weakness of the online activities was that students did not perform any sample preparation. Therefore, they did not experience the extractions and dilutions required to prepare the analytical sample and had a difficult time working backward to calculate starting amounts from simulated sample concentrations. Concerns that students would extract answers from the equations used in the spreadsheet and Jupyter notebook were not realized.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) retention time alignment algorithm was developed using a novel indexing scheme. The algorithm is termed comprehensive because it functions to correct the entire chromatogram in both dimensions and it preserves the separation information in both dimensions. Although the algorithm is demonstrated by correcting comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) data, the algorithm is designed to correct shifting in all forms of 2D separations, such as LC × LC, LC × CE, CE × CE, and LC × GC. This 2D alignment algorithm was applied to three different data sets composed of replicate GC × GC separations of (1) three 22-component control mixtures, (2) three gasoline samples, and (3) three diesel samples. The three data sets were collected using slightly different temperature or pressure programs to engender significant retention time shifting in the raw data and then demonstrate subsequent corrections of that shifting upon comprehensive 2D alignment of the data sets. Thirty 12-min GC × GC separations from three 22-component control mixtures were used to evaluate the 2D alignment performance (10 runs/mixture). The average standard deviation of first column retention time improved 5-fold from 0.020 min (before alignment) to 0.004 min (after alignment). Concurrently, the average standard deviation of second column retention time improved 4-fold from 3.5 ms (before alignment) to 0.8 ms (after alignment). Alignment of the 30 control mixture chromatograms took 20 min. The quantitative integrity of the GC × GC data following 2D alignment was also investigated. The mean integrated signal was determined for all components in the three 22-component mixtures for all 30 replicates. The average percent difference in the integrated signal for each component before and after alignment was 2.6\%. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was applied to the 22-component control mixture data before and after alignment to show the restoration of trilinearity to the data, since trilinearity benefits chemometric analysis. By applying comprehensive 2D retention time alignment to all three data sets (control mixtures, gasoline samples, and diesel samples), classification by principal component analysis (PCA) substantially improved, resulting in 100\% accurate scores clustering.},

  abstract = {Online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography has become an attractive option for the analysis of complex nonvolatile samples found in various fields (e.g. environmental studies, food, life, and polymer sciences). Two-dimensional liquid chromatography complements the highly popular hyphenated systems that combine liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography is also applied to the analysis of samples that are not compatible with mass spectrometry (e.g. high-molecular-weight polymers), providing important information on the distribution of the sample components along chemical dimensions (molecular weight, charge, lipophilicity, stereochemistry, etc.). Also, in comparison with conventional one-dimensional liquid chromatography, two-dimensional liquid chromatography provides a greater separation power (peak capacity). Because of the additional selectivity and higher peak capacity, the combination of two-dimensional liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry allows for simpler mixtures of compounds to be introduced in the ion source at any given time, improving quantitative analysis by reducing matrix effects. In this review, we summarize the rationale and principles of two-dimensional liquid chromatography experiments, describe advantages and disadvantages of combining different selectivities and discuss strategies to improve the quality of two-dimensional liquid chromatography separations.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is now a routine technique with the development of electrospray ionisation (ESI) providing a simple and robust interface. It can be applied to a wide range of biological molecules and the use of tandem MS and stable isotope internal standards allows highly sensitive and accurate assays to be developed although some method optimisation is required to minimise ion suppression effects. Fast scanning speeds allow a high degree of multiplexing and many compounds can be measured in a single analytical run. With the development of more affordable and reliable instruments, LC-MS is starting to play an important role in several areas of clinical biochemistry and compete with conventional liquid chromatography and other techniques such as immunoassay.},

  abstract = {Wine polyphenols (PPhs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are responsible for two of the main sensory characteristics in defining the complexity and quality of red wines: astringency and aroma. Wine VOCs’ volatility and solubility are strongly influenced by the matrix composition, including the interactions with PPhs. To date, these interactions have not been deeply studied, although the topic is of great interest in oenology. This article reviews the available knowledge on the main physicochemical and sensory effects of polyphenols on the release and perception of wine aromas in orthonasal and retronasal conditions. It describes the molecular insights and the phenomena that can modify VOCs behavior, according to the different chemical classes. It introduces the possible impact of saliva on aroma release and perception through the modulation of polyphenols–aroma compounds interactions. Limitations and possible gaps to overcome are presented together with updated approaches used to investigate those interactions and their effects, as well as future perspectives on the subject.},

In pursuit of this aim, PLS regression and a wavelet-based pre-processing method that we have recently developed called OWAVEC were applied, in order to simultaneously operate two crucial pre-processing steps in multivariate calibration: signal correction and data compression. Several pre-processing methods (mean centering, first derivative and two orthogonal signal correction methods, OSC and DOSC) were additionally applied in order to find calibration models with as best a predictive ability as possible and to evaluate the performance of the OWAVEC method, comparing the respective quality of the different regression models constructed. The calibration model developed after pre-processing derivative spectra by OWAVEC provided high quality results (0.79\% RMSEP), the percentage of robusta variety being predicted with a reliability notably better than that associated with the models constructed from raw spectra and also from data corrected by other orthogonal signal correction methods, and showing a higher model simplicity.},

In the winemaking field, the study of authenticity is all the more necessary, with wine being one of the most adulterated foods, as the monthly reports of the European Commission show. This results in a two-fold problem: consumer expectations are not met and there is a disloyal competition among wine producers in the field. Authenticity has been a priority research direction worldwide for centuries. Today, researchers are working on improving already existing methods of authenticity monitoring, but also on creating new ones. The intention is to have results that are as accurate, fast and inexpensive as possible for confirmation or rejection of the hypothesis. The bibliographic study of the literature undertaken for the development of this article aims to identify the classical methods of establishing authenticity, describe them and establish their degree of efficiency. Moreover, a review of the current research trends is presented in this work.},

  abstract = {Complex samples of natural origin, such as, tobacco leaf extracts and coffee bean extracts, comprise a vast number and variety of compounds. The characterisation of such complex samples can be arduous and time consuming. Multidimensional analytical techniques have the potential to provide detailed and informative characterisation data, especially if these techniques exploit separation selectivity and detection selectivity. This thesis explores multidimensional approaches for the analysis of complex samples using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and selective detection. Uni-dimensional HPLC (1DHPLC) multi-detection and multiplexed detection through the use of Active Flow Technology (AFT) columns were used to characterise tobacco leaf extracts to determine key chemical entities by systematically reducing the data complexity of the sample whilst obtaining a greater degree of molecule-specific information. Even though substantial chemical data was obtained, there were limitations; in particular the separation performance of 1DHPLC. This lead to studies directed towards two-dimensional HPLC (2DHPLC), where separation selectivity could be exploited by optimising stationary phase and mobile phase combinations; tailored to the characteristics of the sample. In this work, various combinations of stationary and mobile phases were explored to determine the optimal 2DHPLC selectivity conditions for the separation and analysis of tobacco leaf extracts. However, the performance of 2DHPLC is compromised by the interface between each dimension, namely the compatibility of the solvents and the volume of fluid required in the transfer from the first to the second dimension. This incompatibility often results in loss of separation performance. A preliminary investigation was therefore undertaken to assess the performance of AFT columns in 2DHPLC. The outcomes from this work showed that efficiency and sensitivity could both be improved with the use of AFT columns, however, the results were highly dependent on the construction of the HPLC system.},

The PSF column not only allows a platform for multiplexed detection but also the combination of both destructive and non-destructive detectors, without additional dead volume tubing, simultaneously. The amount of flow through each port can also be adjusted through pressure management to suit the requirements of a specific detector(s). To achieve multiplexed detection using a PSF column there are a number of parameters which can be controlled to ensure optimal separation performance and quality of results; that is tube dimensions for each port, choice of port for each type of detector and flow adjustment. This protocol is intended to show how to use and tune a PSF column functioning in a multiplexed mode of detection.},

This thiazolidine-2,4-dione is susceptible to epimerization through an enol-type intermediate, predominantly in protic solvents. While acetonitrile would provide both necessary sample solubility and sample stability for chromatographic analysis, significant peak fronting was observed when it was used as the diluent with a concomitant loss in resolution. Similar fronting was not observed when preparing sample solutions in ethanol, 2-propanol, methanol, or a 1:1 mixture of methanol and ethanol. The source of this fronting was explored by performing two sample loading studies: constant sample loading with varying volume and constant volume with varying loading. Peak asymmetry was used as a quantitative measure of the resulting peak fronting. These analyses indicate that the fronting observed when using acetonitrile as a diluent could arise due to a strong-solvent like effect of this solvent and or the solubility of the solute in the microenvironment with this combination of column packing and eluent.},

In light of this new framework we review the role of relevance in three prominent theories in the motivation literature: the four-phase model of interest development (), expectancy-value theory (), and self-determination theory (). We then explore eight relevance constructs commonly used in the literature and the educational interventions that derive from them. Finally, we offer a synthesis of these constructs and suggest some directions for future research.},

Aflatoxins were extracted from cereal flour samples by a methanol:phosphate buffer (pH 5.8, I=0.1) (80:20, v/v) solution, followed by a SPME step. Different SPME and HPLC–PD–FD parameters (fiber polarity, temperature, pH, ionic strength, adsorption and desorption time, mobile phase) have been investigated and optimized. This method, which was assessed for the analysis of different cereal flours, showed interesting results in terms of LOD (from 0.035 to 0.2ngg−1), LOQ (from 0.1 to 0.63ngg−1, respectively), within and inter-day repeatability (2.27\% and 5.38\%, respectively) linear ranges (up to 20ngg−1 for AFB1 and AFG1 and 6ngg−1 for AFB2 and AFG2), and total raw extraction efficiency (in the range 55–59\% at concentrations in the range 0.3–1ngg−1 and 49–52\% at concentrations in the range 1–10ngg−1). The results were also compared with the purification step carried out by conventional immunoaffinity columns.},

Wines from 22 pure varieties (autochthonous from Southern Italy and grown in the same area of Apulia) were genetically identified and metabolically characterized using both NMR and HPLC-MS. NMR associated with chemometrics was used to identify amino acid (proline, alanine, and tyrosine), organic acid (malic, lactic, acetic, and succinic acids), alcohol (2-phenylethanol), sugar (sucrose), and polyphenol (gallic acid) contents. Minor components of wines were determined using HPLC-MS analyses. Wines showed potential health-promoting effects with good amounts of phenolic compounds. In particular, consistent levels of trans-resveratrol and flavonoids were found in Negro Amaro, Uva di Troia, Ancellotta, and Montepulciano wines.},

The ANN-linked LM model produced minimal differences between predicted and observed values of output parameters (or CAAs), low mean squared error and higher correlation coefficient values in comparison to the respective values produced by face-centered CCD model.

The use of fluorescence data from an absorbance and transmission excitationemission matrix (A-TEEM) technique for discrimination of wines according to geographical origin was investigated in comparison to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The two approaches were applied to commercial Cabernet Sauvignon wines from vintage 2015 originating from three wine regions of Australia, along with Bordeaux, France. Extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis (XGBDA) was examined among other multivariate algorithms for classification of wines. Models were cross-validated and performance was described in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. XGBDA classification afforded 100\% correct class assignment for all tested regions using the EEM of each sample, and overall 97.7\% for ICP-MS. The novel combination of A-TEEM and XGBDA was found to have great potential for accurate authentication of wines.},

  abstract = {Column wall effects are well recognized as major limiting factor in achieving high separation efficiency in HPLC. This is especially important for modern analytical columns packed with small particles, where wall effects dominate the band broadening. Detailed knowledge about the packing microstructure of packed analytical columns has so far not been acquired. Here, we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction protocol for these columns utilizing focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) on a commercial 2.1 mm inner diameter x 50 mm length narrow-bore analytical column packed with 1.7 mu m bridged-ethyl hybrid silica particles. Two sections from the packed bed are chosen for reconstruction by FIB-SEM: one from the bulk packing region of the column and one from its critical wall region. This allows quantification of structural differences between the wall region and the center of the bed due to effects induced by the hard, confining column wall. Consequences of these effects on local flow velocity in the column are analyzed with flow simulations utilizing the lattice-Boltzmann method. The reconstructions of the bed structures reveal significant structural differences in the wall region (extending radially over approximately 62 particle diameters) compared to the center of the column. It includes the local reduction of the external porosity by up to 10\% and an increase of the mean particle diameter by up to 3\%, resulting in a decrease of the local flow velocity by up to 23\%. In addition, four (more ordered) layers of particles in the direct vicinity of the column wall induce local velocity fluctuations by up to a factor of three regarding the involved velocity amplitudes. These observations highlight the impact of radial variations in packing microstructure on band migration and column performance. This knowledge on morphological peculiarities of column wall effects helps guiding us towards further optimization of the packing process for analytical HPLC columns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ever-increasing trend in the advance on untargeted analysis by spectroscopic analytical platforms, to obtain the so-called "fingerprint", is showed. Moreover, the synergistic relationship with chemometric approaches as fast analytical methodologies able to solve these challenging analytical issues is put on stage. In this context, a critical change in the terminology fingerprint by spectralprint is discussed. In addition, a deep knowledge about advantages and weaknesses of each spectroscopy technique is presented. The advance of data handling and data modelling applications and updating about the latest chemometric tools and strategies to better exploit the acquired spectroscopic data from current instrumentation are also exposed. Finally, novelty prospects in wines and wine vinegars analysis are revealed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Analysis of untargeted gas-chromatographic data is time consuming. With the earlier introduction of the PARAFAC2 (PARAllel FACtor analysis 2) based PARADISe (PARAFAC2 based Deconvolution and Identification System) approach in 2017, this task was made considerably more time-efficient. However, there are still a number of manual steps in the analysis which require data analytical expertise. One of these is the need to define whether or not each PARAFAC2 resolved component represents a peak suitable for integration. As the peaks may change in both shape and location on the elution time-axis, this presents a problem which cannot be readily solved by applying a linear classifier, such as PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares regression for Discriminant Analysis). As part of our ongoing efforts to further automate analysis of Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), we therefore explore a convolutional neural network classifier, capable of handling these shifts and variations in shape. The theory of convolutional neural networks and application on vector samples is briefly explained, and the performance is tested against a PLS-DA classifier, a shallow artificial neural network and a locally weighted regression model. The models are built on a training set with PARAFAC2 resolved components from eight different aroma related GC-MS runs with a total of over 70,000 elution profile samples, and validated using another, independent, GC-MS dataset. Based on Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) and manual analysis of the misclassified cases, it is shown that the convolutional network consistently outperforms the competing models, yielding an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.95 for peak classification. Examples are given illustrating that this new approach provides convincing means to automatically assess and evaluate modelled elution profiles of chromatographic data and thereby remove this laborious manual step.},

Metabolomics aims to measure a wide breadth of small molecules in the context of physiological stimuli or in disease states. Metabolomics methodologies fall into two distinct groups; untargeted metabolomics, an intended comprehensive analysis of all the measurable analytes in a sample including chemical unknowns, and targeted metabolomics, the measurement of defined groups of chemically characterized and biochemically annotated metabolites. The methodologies considered in this unit focus on the processes of conducting targeted metabolomics experiments, and the advantages of this general approach are highlighted herein. This unit outlines the procedures for extracting nitrogenous metabolites, including the amino acids, lipids, and intermediary metabolites, including the TCA cycle oxoacids, from blood plasma. Specifically, protocols for the analysis of these metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics experiments is discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite their technological savvy, most students entering university lack the necessary computer skills to succeed in a quantitative analysis course, in which they are often expected to input, analyze, and plot results of experiments without any previous formal education in Microsoft Excel or similar programs. This lack of formal education results in increased anxiety, students spending large amounts of time using the process of “trial and error” to complete the assignments, and detracts from the students’ learning of the chemistry. Microsoft Excel tutorials that were previously introduced have either been not specific to chemistry, require multiple assignments throughout the semester to acquire the necessary skills, or are designed for deprecated versions of the software. In this work, we present an argument for implementing a chemistry-specific, version-agnostic spreadsheet interactive laboratory exercise that uses basic, general chemistry concepts to have students explore and learn the computer skills that are necessary to succeed in a quantitative analysis course. Student feedback data indicate that students felt that the interactive spreadsheet lab allowed them to develop skills that they identified as necessary for success in the course as well as for their future careers.},

  abstract = {Montepulciano is one of the most famous and important red-berried grapes of Italy. This article presents and discusses a comparative study of aroma profile and phenolic content of the Montepulciano wine from the Marches and the Abruzzo regions. The volatile composition of wines was determined by using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The PDMS fibre was chosen. The dominating esters in Montepulciano wines were ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl octanoate, whereas phenyl ethanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol were dominating alcohols. Phenolic compounds, namely gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, caffeic acid, trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin, were examined using HPLC–MS with direct injection of wine samples. The total phenolic content of the analysed wines was in the range of 30.4–61.9mgl−1. The presence of high amounts of esters seems to characterise the volatiles of Montepulciano wines from the Marches, whereas a high level of alcohols was found in Montepulciano wines from Abruzzo. Moreover, multivariate chemometric techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis, supported this thesis. Headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to analyse 20 commercial wine samples (Montepulciano monovarietal red wines) from the Marches (10 samples) and Abruzzo (10 samples).},

  abstract = {In the early days of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), it was categorized as high-pressure or dense gas chromatography (HPGC or DGC) and low boiling point hydrocarbons were used as supercritical mobile phase. Various liquids and gases were examined, however, by the late 1970s, carbon dioxide (CO2) became the most preferred fluid because it has low critical temperature (31.1°C) and relatively low critical pressure (7.38~MPa); in addition, it is non-toxic, non-flammable and inexpensive. A prototype of a modern packed-column SFC instrument appeared in the late 1970s. However, in the 1980s, as open tubular capillary columns appeared and there was keen competition with packed columns. And packed-column SFC at once became less popular, but it regained popularity in the early 1990s. The history of SFC was of “the rise and fall.” Advances in chiral stationary phase took place in the early 1990s made packed-column SFC truly useful chiral separation method and SFC is now regarded as an inevitable separation tool both in analytical and preparative separation.},

The columns brownish inlet section was physically removed with a lathe, leaving a clean white inlet section. The original and regenerated columns were extensively analyzed and compared using numerical tools for processing adsorption data. The perturbation peak method was used to measure the adsorption isotherm of phenol on the original and regenerated monolith and the adsorption energy distributions were calculated for identifying any change in the degree of heterogeneity. Although peak shapes improved considerably after regeneration, no significant differences were found in the detailed characterization of the processed adsorption data between the original column and the regenerated one. This indicates that the removal of a section of the monolithic bed can be undertaken without damaging the column and columns in which their inlet head sections are contaminated may still function with normal adsorption behavior. In addition, the combined thermodynamic and kinetic methodology could accurately be used to evaluate any regeneration method of columns.},

This current communication is the first in a series focusing on the impact of exogenous factors on the column bed heterogeneity. This study is based on several observations by us and others that chromatographic runs often, for technical reasons, include more or less portions of air in the injections. It is therefore extremely important to find out the impact of air on the column performance, the reliability of the results derived from analyses where air was injected, and the effect on the column homogeneity. We used a photographic approach for visualising the air transport phenomena, and found that the air transport through the column is comprised of many different types of transport phenomena, such as laminal flow, viscous fingering like flows, channels and bulbs, and pulsations. More particularly, the air clouds within the column definitely interact in the adsorption, i.e. mobile phase adsorbed to the column surface is displaced. In addition, irrespective of the type of air transport phenomena, the air does not penetrate the column homogeneously. This process is strongly flow dependent. In this work we study air transport both in an analytical scale and a semi-prep column. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

With this study we aim at first hand to investigate if viscous fingering or any similar and related effects to these in preparative levels also take place in analytical scale HPLC and if so, what impact this have on the separation performance. We could show that not only viscous finger does occur in analytical scale columns but also that peak distortions are apparent already at viscosity ratios between eluent and sample solution approaching unity. The latter indicates that a pre-viscous phenomenon is occurring that could be more important than the viscous fingering itself at the analytical format. As the viscosity contrast increases, the leading edge of the sample band distorts and the band volume increases, both leading to a decrease in performance. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A considerable amount of literature has been published claiming the cardiovascular benefits of moderate (red) wine drinking, which has been considered a distinguishing trait of the Mediterranean diet. Indeed, red wine contains relevant amounts of polyphenols, for which evidence of their biological activity and positive health effects are abundant; however, it is also well-known that alcohol, even at a low level of intake, may have severe consequences for health. Among others, it is directly related to a number of non-communicable diseases, like liver cirrhosis or diverse types of cancer. The IARC classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, causally associated with the development of cancers of the upper digestive tract and liver, and, with sufficient evidence, can be positively associated with colorectum and female breast cancer. In these circumstances, it is tricky, if not irresponsible, to spread any message on the benefits of moderate wine drinking, about which no actual consensus exists. It should be further considered that other hallmarks of the Mediterranean diet are the richness in virgin olive oil, fruits, grains, and vegetables, which are also good sources of polyphenols and other phytochemicals, and lack the risks of wine. All of these aspects are reviewed in this article.},

In order to extract information of different families of phenolic compounds, profiles of different UV–vis absorption wavelengths (280, 310, 370 and 520 nm) and fluorescence (ex = 260 nm; em = 360 nm) were analysed. A total of thirteen phenolic compounds which allowed the discrimination of wines of three different Spanish appellations (Penedes, Rioja and Ribera del Duero) were selected by means of principal component analysis (PCA). Afterwards, these compounds were used to build partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS1-DA and PLS2-DA) models which allowed the discrimination of wines according to their appellation with classification rates for independent test sets higher than 96\% and 93\% for PLS1-DA and PLS2-DA models respectively. Finally, characteristic compounds of each appellation were tentatively identified by means of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. Thus, ten out of thirteen compounds (i.e., gallic acid for Penedes, trans-coumaroyltartaric and trans-caffeoyltartaric acids for Rioja and myricetin for Ribera del Duero wines) have been proposed.},

Firstly, the wall effect is discussed, and how it can amplify viscosity contrast effects. We then illustrate how viscosity contrasts lead to the phenomenon known as viscous fingering, and we detail the destructive effects of this phenomenon. We expand on the viscous fingering component, however, demonstrating that viscosity contrast effects begin to deteriorate performance long before the conditions are such that viscous fingering occurs. Subtle changes in band-shape are apparent even with very low viscosity contrasts. Lastly we illustrate how viscosity contrast effects lead to severe peak distortions in SFC. Analysts who seek high efficiency separations must make every effort to eliminate, or at least minimise the viscosity contrast between the injection plug and the mobile phase. © 2016},

  abstract = {The interface between two fluids that have different viscosities and are percolating through a porous bed is unstable. Sooner or later, a flow instability termed viscous fingering (VF) develops. This phenomenon is important in chromatography because the solute plug does not have the same viscosity as the mobile phase. Because the sample is often much more viscous than the mobile phase, it is the interface at the rear of the sample band that is usually unstable. This situation is frequent in many modes of chromatography, e.g., in preparative and in multidimensional chromatography, in size exclusion chromatography, in frontal analysis. and in other physicochemical measurements (e.g., determination of adsorption isotherms and of mass transfer parameters). When the solute plug is more viscous than the mobile phase, we observed that the solute band compressed. When the viscosity contrast increased up to 0.30 cP, fingers appeared to trail behind the solute plug. The development of fingers then became more substantial as the viscosity contrast increased. To avoid effects associated with VF, the mobile phase and the solute plug should have nearly the same viscosity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The effect of solvent viscosity mismatch on elution performance in reversed-phase HPLC was studied using moment analysis. Two conditions were tested: (1) the mobile phase viscosity was less than the injection plug viscosity, and (2) the mobile phase viscosity was greater than the injection plug viscosity. Under the first condition, retention time and elution performance decreased as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and injection plug increased. The effect on performance was more marked as the injection volume increased. A decrease in performance of 12\% for compounds with retention factors up to 2.8 was apparent even when the viscosity contrast was only 0.165 cP. In the second set of conditions, elution performance was actually observed to increase, by as much as 25\% for a 40 μL injection, as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and the solute plug increased. No change in the retention factor was observed. This behaviour was attributed to the shape of an injection plug as it enters into the column, whereby a low viscosity plug permeates away from the wall when the column contains a higher viscosity mobile phase, and vice a versa for a high viscosity plug entering a low viscosity mobile phase. At no stage was either a band splitting or shoulders observed with viscosity contrasts up to 1.283 cP, as could have been expected.},

The operation of a comprehensive method of analysis was compared to a heart‐cutting approach. The comprehensive approach employed a high resolution diastereomer separation in the first dimension and a low peak capacity C18, high speed separation according to molecular weight. Because of solvent incompatibility between the dimensions in the comprehensive method, successful separation of the diastereomers of the oligomers was not possible. The heart‐cutting approach used a C18 monolith in the first dimension, which was selective only for molecular weight. Entire molecular weight fractions were then transported to the second dimension in an online heart‐cutting process for the separation of diastereomers. The heart‐cutting process was more successful in that 228 components of the 511 within the sample were recognized. This series of separations was undertaken in less than 6 h.},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of viscosity contrast induced flow instabilities is an important aspect in the design of two-dimensional HPLC separations. When the viscosity contrast between the sample plug and the mobile phase is sufficiently large, the phenomenon known as viscous fingering can be induced. Viscous fingering is a flow instability phenomenon that occurs at the interface between two fluids with different viscosities. In liquid chromatography, viscous fingering results in the solute band undergoing a change in form as it enters into the chromatography column. Moreover, even in the absence of viscous fingering, band shapes change shape at low viscosity contrasts. These changes can result in a noticeable change in separation performance, with the result depending on whether the solvent pushing the solute plug has a higher or lower viscosity than the solute plug. These viscosity induced changes become more important as the solute injection volume increases and hence understanding the process becomes critical in the implementation of multidimensional HPLC techniques, since in these techniques the sample injection plug into the second dimension is an order of magnitude greater than in one-dimensional HPLC. This review article assesses the current understanding of the viscosity contrast induced processes as they relate to liquid chromatographic separation behaviour.},

One contributing factor to the variability in the flow velocity stems from the heterogeneity in the radial packing density, leading to what has been described as the 'wall-effect'. The wall-effect generates parabolic-type elution profiles, which dilutes the sample and creates tailing bands. In this communication a new column technology is discussed that has been designed to overcome the wall effect, minimising the limitations associated with packing heterogeneity. This technology has been referred to as active flow technology and consists of two types of column designs, parallel segmented flow and curtain flow. In both these column designs sample that elutes through the column in the radial central region of the bed is separated from the flow that elutes along the wall region. Hence, the sample that elutes through the most efficiently packed region of the bed is collected to the detector. As a consequence more theoretical plates are obtained, and sensitivity is increased since the sample is not diluted by the diffuse tail. Sensitivity is enhanced further in the curtain flow design. The benefits of these new columns are discussed (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The outlet segmentation ratio was varied to enable different volume fractions of mobile phase, and thus sample, to elute from the peripheral and central flow regions of the column. The amount of solute exiting the peripheral and radial central exit ports was determined as a function of the flow segmentation ratio. The experimental data using an analytical scale column with dimensions, 100x4.6mm, indicated that the sample load distribution was essentially uniform as a function of the column radial cross section.

In this article we setup the possibility of using new approach using new EIM – Module – IRMS (Ethanol Isotope Measurement – Module – Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) instrumental technique and new analytical parameter δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$}(δ\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}H\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$}) wine ethanol value, which represents δ\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}H value of non-exchangeable hydrogen stable isotope ratio in ethanol, with other isotopic species (δ\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$}O values in wine water) to improve detection of illegal wine production practices such as addition of sugar and/or dilution with water. Total of 42 wine samples were analyzed. 10 wine samples (out of 42) were prepared from grapes by alcoholic fermentation and analyzed for δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} values of ethanol. 19 wine samples (out of 42) were collected from wine producers in Serbia plus 1 wine samples designated from United States was taken from Serbian market and analyzed for δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} values of ethanol, δ\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$}O values in wine water and also δ\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C values in wine ethanol. Furthermore 9 wine samples (out of 42) were taken from Hungarian market and analyzed for δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} values of ethanol, and also 3 wine samples (out of 42) were taken from Austrian market and analyzed for δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} values of ethanol. All experiments were done in 4 isotope laboratories located in US, Austria, Hungary and People's Republic of China. δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} values of ethanol were measured by using EIM Module connected to FlashHT 2000 pyrolizer (one laboratory – Imprint Analytics GmbH, Austria), while in other 3 laboratories (US – COIL – Cornell University, Stable Isotope Laboratory, Hungary – Isotoptech Ltd, Debrecen, Hungary and China – C.N.R.I.F.F.I. – China National Institute of Food and Fermentation Industries Limited) EIM Module was connected to TC/EA (High Temperature Conversion Elemental Analyzer). Peripherals in all laboratories were further interfaced with isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Furthermore δ\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$}O values in wine water were measured by using Gas Bench II interfaced also with isotope ratio mass spectrometer (one laboratory – US). Obtained results from all 4 laboratories have shown that this new approach which uses δD\textsubscript{n{$<$}sub/{$>$} in wine ethanol is more effective in improving detection of illegal wine production practices (sugar enrichment and water dilution) and origin of ethanol, and also detecting the addition of corn or beet sugar, sugar syrup to wine, or dilution of grape must with water prior to alcoholic fermentation.\textbf{Keywords:{$<$}b/{$>$} Wine authenticity; EIM – Module – IRMS; Stable Isotope; Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry; Wine; Watering; Chaptalization.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Before statistical comparison, registration must be established to match corresponding analytes from run to run. Alignment, the most popular correspondence approach, consists of constructing a function that warps the content of runs to most closely match a given reference sample. To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples. We suggest and describe a paradigm shift for overcoming current correspondence limitations by building on known liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry behavior.},

Additionally, the stability testing of both surfaces, throughout the chromatographic testing, demonstrates no degradation of the surface or column bed. HETP curves improved after endcapping, further more, the Tanaka test's hydrogen bonding value also reduced by 35\%, indicating the minimization of the residual silanol groups. The LSS model showed excellent linearity for both surfaces (R-2{$>$}0.991), and the phenyl endcapped monolith had comparable aromatic selectivity to a phenyl particle packed column.},

  abstract = {This study illustrates a procedure for producing different high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phases, on demand, for silica monoliths. Two commercial first-generation analytical scale bare silica monoliths were subjected to a "remodification" process that involved the following: (1) coating of the silica through an in situ silylation procedure to bond ligands of choice to the surface, (2) periodic chromatographic characterization of the coated surface over 2,000 column volumes, and (3) removing the bonded ligands using a 0.1 M hydrochloric (HCI) acid wash, to regenerate the initial silica surface. This remodification protocol was repeated for three cycles to fabricate monoliths with selected functionalities. To test reproducibility, this study was conducted on two different commercial silica monoliths subjected to this treatment involving synthetic reactions with organo-silanes and subsequent stripping with acid washes. Both monoliths were functionalized with three different coatings, without significant degradation of the initial columns' silica infrastructure and excellent stability (tested up to 2,000 column volumes). One of the monoliths had measured theoretical plates per meter (N/m) of 57,000 N/m for the original silica surface, 105,000 N/m for the first cyano coating, and 60,000 N/m for the third phenyl coating. The stationary phases prepared by remodification possessed similar selectivities to those synthesized from new silica monoliths. The results of the Tanaka test shows evidence of residual ligands of previous coatings. However, the methylene and phenyl selectivity proved to display the same characteristics as other modified monoliths of the same functionality, not subjected to the remodified process.

Three problematic pesticides, notorious for poor peak shape and ionization issues were selected to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing the PSF column as an alternative front-end separation interface for LC-MS approaches. Assessment of performance for each pesticide was based on a spiked lemon matrix prepared via a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, rugged and safe) sample preparation approach. Comparisons were made between assays conducted using a conventional column and a PSF column (operated with a 40\% segmentation ratio), each packed with identical stationary phases and of the same column format. Both columns were connected to the MS detector using the exact same connective tubing and electrospray (ESI) conditions. The primary advantage of the PSF column was that it enabled an increase in throughput by at least 2.5 times compared to the conventional HPLC column. At the same time, the volumetric flow to the MS was exactly the same for both the PSF column and the conventional column. Effectively there was no difference in the sensitivity provided by peak areas between the PSF and conventional columns: peak area LOQ values were comparable, 4-9 mu g/kg for the PSF and 4-8 mu g/kg for the conventional column. This is a vital requirement for food control methods to secure absence at default maximum residue limit (MRL) of 10 mu g/kg (10 ppb) level. Since the efficiency of the PSF was superior to that of the conventional column, the peak width of eluting components was reduced by as mud). as 70\% in the former compared to the peak widths on the latter. Hence, the PSF column provides greater peak capacity and this will enable faster analysis of complex samples.},

A plug and play study to demonstrate the potential of the Parallel Segmented Flow (PSF) column technology without any changes to the separation or detection programmed settings can facilitate microflow separations on a HPLC 400 bar hyphenated MS system. Here, we present the PSF column that interfaced 54 mu L/min with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. Advantages of this alternative plug and play PSF microflow interfacing strategy include robust HPLC separation \% RSD retention times {$<$}= 0.38\% and mobile phase consumption comparable to UHPLC consumption rates of 9 mL per analysis. The calculated matrix effect for microflow PSF was representative of reduced ion suppression/enhancement ({$<$} +/- 20\%), with the exception of atrazine in river water which experienced medium suppression ({$<$} +/- 30\%). The \%ME is not yet competitive with capillary scale columns. The instrument detection limits (IDLs) calculated takes into account the variability (\%RSD) and amount reaching the detector. The PSF had lower IDLs (3.09-7.66 pg) compared to the conventional column (1.53-31.61 pg), with the exception of atrazine's peak height calculation. This communication focused on the microflow PSF operation strictly on conventional HPLC tandem MS system, without hardware upgrades, and applicability for robust organic contaminant separations in environmental matrices (soil and river water).},

Key separation metrics were evaluated: (a) peak capacity, (b) total analysis time and (c) mobile phase consumption. An average peak width of 0.10 min with a total analysis time (inclusive of the column wash and re-equilibration) of 10 minutes revealed the increased productivity and performance of the parallel segmented flow (PSF) column technology HPLC-MS strategy, comparable to UHPLC peak widths and analysis times, achieved at a significantly lower backpressure ({$<$}400 bar). The operation of the PSF in a narrow-bore scale format (internal diameter of 2.1 mm) resulted in a conservative HPLC scale total mobile phase consumption of 15 mL for the column separation; only 5.5 mL of this volume was exposed to the ion source per injection. Mobile phase consumption was higher compared to that of UHPLC, but on the other hand it achieved higher peak capacity. Three representative compounds (atrazine, diclofenac and fluazuron) with differing retention and ionisation properties were studied in detail in terms of detection sensitivity. The majority of the ion ratios for the standards in the river water matrix were within +30\% of the average ion ratios. The largest ion suppression occurred for atrazine (-25\% matrix effect), a pesticide notorious for poor ionization and poor peak shape issues. The lowest response transitions at 1 mu g L-1 for the extracted ions in the river water matrix of atrazine, diclofenac and fluazuron had signal to noise ratios {$>$}= 3, with the exception of diclofenac where 5 mu g L-1 was the lowest calibration level.

Besides wet chemistry, these include chromatography, isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which have been applied in recent years in combination with chemometric approaches. For many years,               2               H NMR spectroscopy was the method of choice and achieved official recognition in the detection of sugar addition to grape products. Recently,               1               H NMR spectroscopy, a simpler and faster method (in terms of sample preparation), has gathered more and more attention in wine analysis, even if it still lacks official recognition. This technique makes targeted quantitative determination of wine ingredients and nontargeted detection of the metabolomic fingerprint of a wine sample possible. This review summarizes the possibilities and limitations of               1               H NMR spectroscopy in analytical wine authentication, by reviewing its applications as reported in the literature.

  abstract = {Wine authentication is vital in identifying malpractice and fraud, and various physical and chemical analytical techniques have been employed for this purpose. Besides wet chemistry, these include chromatography, isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which have been applied in recent years in combination with chemometric approaches. For many years, H-2 NMR spectroscopy was the method of choice and achieved official recognition in the detection of sugar addition to grape products. Recently, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, a simpler and faster method (in terms of sample preparation), has gathered more and more attention in wine analysis, even if it still lacks official recognition. This technique makes targeted quantitative determination of wine ingredients and nontargeted detection of the metabolomic fingerprint of a wine sample possible. This review summarizes the possibilities and limitations of H-1 NMR spectroscopy in analytical wine authentication, by reviewing its applications as reported in the literature. Examples of commercial and open-source solutions combining NMR spectroscopy and chemometrics are also examined herein, together with its opportunities of becoming an official method.},

Flavonoids mainly consist of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and flavonols whereas non-flavonoids include hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids. In the present study, sixteen phenolic compounds from ten red and nine white grape wine varieties were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Gallic acid, Vanillic acid, Rutin hydrate, Ellagic acid, Chlorogenic acid, Sorbic acid, Catechin hydrate, Epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, Quercetin, Myricetin, Kaempferol, Piceatannol, and Resveratrol were major compounds found in red wine grapes. Among the varieties, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc showed maximum quantitative phenolics, whereas Cabernet Sauvignon, Niellucio, Cinsaut, and Syrah showed least quantitative phenolics in grape berries. Phenolic profile of white wine grapes showed lower concentration of phenolics than that of red wine grapes. The variety Gros Meseng showed maximum phenolics followed by Sauvignon, while the variety Colombard and Chenin Blanc showed least phenolics.},

Two classification methods were compared: soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with wavelength selection by the successive projections algorithm (SPA). The best results were obtained by SPA–LDA, which correctly classified all test samples. The classification accuracy of this model remained high (96\%) even after the introduction of artificial spectral noise. These results suggest that UV–Vis spectrometry and SPA–LDA modelling provide a promising alternative for assessment of conservation state and decaffeination condition of coffee samples.},

IEC–PCR separation was achieved within 14min using the mobile phase containing 3mmolL−1 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (PDCA) and 3mmolL−1 oxalate at pH 12.5. Effects of pH as well as PAN, detergent and chloride ion concentrations during post-column reaction on detector response were examined. Detection limits were less than 4.5μgL−1 for all metals except Hg(II) (19μgL−1) using spectrophotometric measurements at 550nm. Analytical validations showed good linearity for detection up to 6.0mgL−1, with R2 higher than 0.99. Precisions based on retention time evaluation for intra-day and inter-day measurements with the relative standard deviation (RSD) were less than 2.9\% and 3.6\%, respectively. The method gave good accuracy with the recoveries ranged from 80.5 to 105\% for all metal ions studied. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of metal ions in environmental samples (leachate, soil and sediment) in Northeastern Thailand. The results were in good agreement with atomic spectroscopic measurements on the same samples.},

The Wikipedia article on Gradient Boosting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradien... NOTE: The key to understanding how the wikipedia article relates to this video is to keep reading past the "pseudo algorithm" section. The very next section in the article called "Gradient Tree Boosting" shows how the algorithm works for trees (which is pretty much the only weak learner people ever use for gradient boost, which is why I focus on it in the video). In that section, you see how the equation is modified so that each leaf from a tree can have a different output value, rather than the entire "weak learner" having a single output value - and this is the exact same equation that I use in the video. Later in the article, in the section called "Shrinkage", they show how the learning rate can be included. Since this is also pretty much always used with gradient boost, I simply included it in the base algorithm that I describe.

With regression trees, the sample will only go to a single leaf, and this summation simply isolates the one output value of interest from all of the others. However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any "weak learner", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm. 24:15, the header for the residual column should be r\_i,2. \#statquest \#gradientboost},

Sensor fusion provides a collaborative approach with those sensors, in order to improve the quality assessment of the product and assure the consumer a high-quality produce. Sensor fusion has already been applied to fruit quality, but there is a lack of a general methodology for its design. A methodology in eight steps is proposed. This methodology has been tested and validated on various commodities, and two examples are described (melon, peach). These examples show the importance of sensor fusion as a multidisciplinary approach, and the difficulty in choosing the proper fusion technique. The proposed methodology turns out to be sufficiently general to be applicable to other food products.},

It is concluded that HPLC can be applied successfully in virtually all areas of pharmaceutical analysis. CZE has a promising future in the analysis of drugs and in the field of biotechnological analysis, where a high number of plates is required together with short analysis time. Nevertheless improvements in detection are still necessary for most applications. SFC is particularly suitable for moderately polar compounds or substances for which mass-sensitive detection is required. SFC and CZE can be considered as complementary to HPLC owing to the orthogonality of the acquired data, and as a result more information can be obtained from the analysis.},

  abstract = {Phenyl-type stationary phase surfaces are useful for the separation of highly aromatic compounds because of the extensive intermolecular forces between the -electron systems. For this reason, we studied the retention behaviour and selectivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on Synergi polar-RP and Cosmosil 5PBB chromatography columns using methanol/water, acetonitrile/water, benzene spiked (0.5\%) methanol/water, and benzene spiked (0.5\%) acetonitrile/water mobile phases. These four solvent systems were employed because pi-pi interactions between the aromatic solute (i.e., PAH) and the aromatic stationary phase should be inhibited in mobile phases that are also pi electron rich, and hence a competitor for the analyte. Our results showed that the acetonitrile mobile phases were substantially stronger eluents than the methanol mobile phases, which was consistent with the premise that retention of aromatic compounds is sensitive to pi-pi interactions. Aside from changes in absolute retention, selectivity of the PAHs was also generally greater in methanol rather than acetonitrile mobile phases because the methanol did not attenuate the pi-pi bonding interactions between the PAH and the stationary phase; but, despite this, the retention behaviour of the Synergi polar-RP column was similar to that observed on C-18 columns. The excessive retention times of the Cosmosil 5PBB column were decreased dramatically when acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase; however, selectivity between structural isomers was lost.},

These ligands consist of a phenyl ring tethered to the silica support via a carbon chain of length ranging from 0 to 4 atoms. The adsorption isotherm models that fit best to the data account for solute-solute interactions that are likely caused by pi-pi interactions occurring between aromatic compounds and the phenyl group of the ligand. These interactions are the dominant factor responsible for the separation of low molecular weight aromatic compounds on these phenyl-type stationary phases. The saturation capacities depend on whether the spacer of the ligands have an even or an odd number of carbon atoms, with the even alkyl chain lengths having a greater saturation capacity than the odd alkyl chain lengths. The trends in the adsorption equilibrium constant are also significantly different for the even and the odd chain length ligands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Phenyl type stationary phases of increasing spacer chain length (phenyl, methyl phenyl, ethyl phenyl, propyl phenyl and butyl phenyl, with 0-4 carbon atoms in the spacer chain, respectively) were synthesised and packed in house to determine the impact that the spacer chain length has on the retention process. Two trends in the aromatic selectivity, q(aromatic), were observed, depending on whether the number of carbon atoms in the spacer chain is even or odd. Linear log k' vs phi plots were obtained for each stationary phase and the S coefficient was determined from the gradient of these plots. For the phenyl type phases, the S vs n(c) plots of the retention factors of linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons vs the number of rings exhibit a distinct discontinuity that between 3 and 4 rings, which increases with increasing spacer chain length for even phases but decreases for odd phases. Accordingly, we suggest that the retention factors depend differently on the number of carbon atoms in the spacer chain depending on whether this number is even or odd and that this effect is caused by different orientations of the aromatic ring relative to the silica surface.

This paper explores the retention process of these types of stationary phases by examining the retention behaviour of linear PAHs and n-alkylbenzenes on a series of propyl phenyl stationary phases that have changes in their ligand density (1.23, 1.31, 1.97, 2.50 mu mol m(-2)). The aromatic and methylene selectivities increased with increasing ligand density until a point where a plateau was observed, overall the propyl phenyl phases had a higher degree of aromatic selectivity than methylene selectivity indicating that these columns are suitable for separations involving aromatic compounds. Also, retention characteristics relating to the size of the solute molecule were observed to be influenced by the ligand density. It is likely that the changing retention characteristics are caused by the different topologies of the stationary phases at different ligand densities. At high ligand densities, the partition coefficient became constant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results of this analysis of data showed that the measure of separation quality varied markedly, depending on the elution zone for which the test was undertaken. The study concluded that if standards cannot be obtained that adequately describe the entire sample matrix, the sample itself should be used, and also, the separation should be optimized for regions of interest, not necessarily the separation as a whole.},

Following the recognition of peaks, the software then performed a series of statistical assessments of the separation performance, measuring for example, correlation between dimensions, peak capacity and the percentage of usage of the separation space. Peak recognition was achieved by interpreting the first and second derivatives of each respective one-dimensional chromatogram to determine the 1D retention times of each solute and then compiling these retention times for each respective fraction 'cut'. Due to the nature of comprehensive 2DHPLC adjacent cut fractions may contain peaks common to more than one cut fraction. The algorithm determined which components were common in adjacent cuts and subsequently calculated the peak maximum profile by interpolating the space between adjacent peaks. This algorithm was applied to the analysis of a two-dimensional separation of an apple flesh extract separated in a first dimension comprising a cyano stationary phase and an aqueous/THF mobile phase as the first dimension and a second dimension comprising C18-Hydro with an aqueous/MeOH mobile phase. A total of 187 peaks were detected.},

Previous works have found that there are differences in retention characteristics between these chain lengths and this was explored further here. It was found that when analysing the separations by quadrants, using a geometric approach to factor analysis and by measuring the normalised mean radius, subtle differences in the separations were observed and the butyl phenyl phase was more selective for the high to medium polarity species. However, there was very little difference in separation behaviour for the hydrophobic components within the coffee sample. Overall, the analysis of the entire separation showed very little difference.},

To overcome peak analysis problems caused by signal noise and low detection limits the data was pre-processed with penalised least squares smoothing. The porous graphitic carbon × reversed phase combination separated 85 peaks with a spreading angle of 71° and the porous graphitic carbon × hydrophilic interaction chromatography separated 207 peaks with a spreading angle of 80°. Both two dimensional high performance liquid chromatographic were completed in 76 minutes using a comprehensive stop-and-go approach. A smoothing step was added to peak picking processes and was able to greatly reduce the number of false peaks present due to noise in the chromatograms. The required thresholds were not able to ignore the noise because of the small magnitude of the peaks; 1874 peaks were located in the non-smoothed porous graphitic carbon × reversed phase separation that reduced to 227 peaks after smoothing was included.},

  abstract = {The Edwin Smith Papyrus, discovered in 1862 outside of Luxor, Egypt, is the oldest known surgical text in the history of civilization. The surviving scroll, a copy of an earlier text from around 3,000 B.C., gives us remarkable insight into the medical practice of ancient Egyptians in the Nile River bed during the dawn of civilization. The Papyrus is divided into 48 cases, most of which describe traumatic injuries. The text instructs the physician to examine the patient and look for revealing physical signs that may indicate the outcome of the injury. Although in modern medicine we take for granted that the use of physical examination and rational thinking lead to an accurate conclusion, 5,000 years ago, this was extraordinary. The Edwin Smith Papyrus cast aside the prevailing magic and mysticism of that time in favor of logic and deductive reasoning. As Egyptian civilization declined during the next millennium, the teachings of the Papyrus would be lost. It would not be until 300 B.C. when Hippocrates and his disciples in ancient Greece would once again revive logic in medical thinking and teaching. It is believed that the ancient Greeks had knowledge of the contents of the Edwin Smith Papyrus and its teachings and used them as the basis for their writings. As Europe entered the Dark Ages, so did medicine yet again, reverting to spells and prayers instead of judgment and reason. Although Hippocrates teachings were recognized by some scholars during the Middle Ages, they did not make up the basis for mainstream medical knowledge. With the dawn of the Renaissance, medicine would finally purge itself of its past supernatural foundation. Hippocratic teachings were used to form the basis of modern medicine, and medical pioneers in the 17th century studied the ancient Greek texts as the origin for their ideas. Many of the concepts physicians and patients today take as common knowledge originated in the Edwin Smith Papyrus. The authors attempt to uncover some of these fundamental ideas and trace them through time until their incorporation in our modern medical knowledge base. It is the rational, logical, and advanced thinking exhibited in the Edwin Smith Papyrus that mandates its respect from modern otolaryngologists and all physicians alike.},

The spectral data of peaberry and normal coffee were acquired using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Genesys™ 10S UV-Vis, Thermo Scientific, USA). For both supervised discrimination methods, SIMCA and PLS-DA, all samples were correctly classified into their corresponding classes. The SIMCA model classified all samples accurately (100\%) into either the peaberry or normal coffee class, even at a 5\% confidence level; however, the PLS-DA model also correctly classified all samples (100\%). Investigation of the major wavelengths contributing to the classifications using x-loading weights and loading of latent variables (LVs) indicated wavelengths at 230, 250, 270, 310, and 350 nm were important for determination of the coffee types. These wavelengths were closely related to the absorbance wavelengths of several important chemical components in roasted coffee: caffeine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acids (CGA). These results provided the basis for developing a simple and reliable method for peaberry coffee authentication (including more complex samples where peaberry coffee is blended with normal coffees) based on UV-Vis spectra.},

  abstract = {This study is based upon a recently established method for quantification of the antioxidant capacity of natural samples via a HPLC separation and a hyphenated selective detection (post-column derivatization with cupric reducing antioxidant capacity reagent) technique. This protocol demonstrated the main improvements to transform the quantitative protocol into a high-speed qualitative automated assay to screen samples for their potential total antioxidant capacity, typically performed via manual mixing of the sample and derivatisation and measured on a 96 well plate reader/bench top UV-Vis spectrophotometer. This approach with automated mixing is a more informative alternative for total antioxidant capacity as the antioxidant peaks are profiled for each sample within four minutes. This antioxidant profile may be used for routine analysis of raw materials and/or a guide for targeted approaches for structure elucidation for laboratories interested in early drug discovery, natural product research and the search of alternative antioxidant additives in consumer goods/therapeutics. This technique could also be used to monitor the stability, alteration or adulteration of manufactured goods containing antioxidants.},

As a result of being able to utilise narrow bore RF columns, several significant factors have been highlighted, including high resolution post column derivatisation assays and an approximate five-fold decrease in the volume of reagents (mobile phase and PCD reagents) resulting in a reduced cost of the analysis in terms of purchase price and waste disposal. Moreover, the CUPRAC antioxidant assay illustrates a variety of antioxidants in the coffee samples and also presents an extensive level of detection selectivity. Furthermore, the narrow bore RF PCD procedure reveals that caffeine was extracted from the coffee and yet a co-eluting antioxidant was not removed.},

  abstract = {The cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay is an established procedure used to measure antioxidant content. Recently, the CUPRAC assay was adapted for use in post column derivatisation coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-PCD). In prior works reported in the literature, CUPRAC HPLC-PCD assays used large post column mixing coils leading to a deterioration in the observed separation efficiency. In this work we used the CUPRAC PCD assay with reaction flow (RF) chromatography. No reaction loop was required, thus preserving the efficiency of the separation. We subsequently compared the performance of the CUPRAC assay to that of an antioxidant assay that we have previously converted to RF chromatography, namely the ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay, both in RF mode. The relative response factor with respect to trolox was measured for both RF assays via the separation of a standard mixture of 16 compounds. Sample analysis of coffee and green tea via both RF assays was used to compare their ability to screen for bioactive candidates in complex natural products. In general, the CUPRAC assay is recommended as the RF PCD methodology of choice as it provided a higher level of performance compared to the FRAP assay, demonstrating less baseline noise interference, greater sensitivity, wider linear dynamic range and better assay precision.},

One of the increasingly popular coffee products is instant coffee, with consumption exceeding 1.6 million tonnes in 2017. In this work, we present how the combination of 1H NMR and GC–MS allows the characterization of samples from the small pilot-scale instant coffee process. Results were compared with measurements for filter coffee made from the same coffee beans to better evaluate the effects of processing. In the coffee extracted at lower temperatures, a higher concentration of aroma compounds can be detected. This is particularly the case for compounds responsible for earthy (pyrazines) and woody (guaiacols) aroma notes. Also, for the coffee extracted at the highest temperature, a higher level of cyclotene giving undesired burnt and bready aroma is seen. The caffeine content in instant coffees was lower than in the filter coffee (49 ± 13 up to 62 ± 5 mg/100 mL brew for instant compared with 84 ± 15 mg/100 mL brew for filter coffee). The same was observed for acetic acid, while the concentrations of citric and quinic acids are lower in the filter coffee than in the reconstituted instant coffee.},

From this research it is clear that esters are extremely important for the aroma profile of fermented beverages and various dairy products. A large amount of this research is focused on wine and has yielded the genes involved in ester synthesis and hydrolysis in organisms such as Saccharomyces sp. It is also clear from recent research in both the fermented beverage and dairy context that lactic acid bacteria possess an extensive collection of ester synthesising and hydrolysing activities. This review describes the major esters reported in wine and the enzymes responsible for their hydrolysis and synthesis. Ester impact on wine aroma and formation during primary and malolactic fermentation is also evaluated. Finally the potential applications of current knowledge are outlined.},

Wine polyphenols released well during mouth and stomach digestion, and the release rates in the “serum-available” fraction, “colon-available” fraction, and after the colon were much lower. Red wine showed a higher biological activity than white wine, but white wine had a better bioaccessibility than red wine, especially under binge drinking. The bioaccessibility of most polyphenols decreased as the drinking amount increased, indicating that drinking larger volumes of wine did not increase the bioaccessibility of polyphenols. Additionally, the relevant biological activities did not increase as the drinking amount increased. Drinking after a meal showed significantly better results than drinking before a meal in most of the tests. Hence, in order to let wine polyphenols play its functional for human health, there still need a moderate consumption amount of wine and drinking after meal is better.},

  abstract = {Wine is a high-value alcoholic beverage welcomed by consumers because of its flavor and nutritional value. The key information on wine bottle label is the basis of consumers’ choice, which also becomes a target for manufacturers to adulterate, including geographical origin, grape variety and vintage. With the improvement of wine adulteration technology, modern technological means are needed to solve the above mentioned problems. The chemical basis of wine determines the type of technique used. Detection technology can be subdivided into four groups: mass spectrometry techniques, spectroscopic techniques, chromatography techniques, and other techniques. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data was performed by means of chemometrics methods. This paper outlines a series of procedures for wine classification and identification, and classified the analytical techniques and data processing methods used in recent years with listing their principles, advantages and disadvantages to help wine researchers choose appropriate methods to meet the challenge and ensure wine traceability and authenticity.},

Therefore, I took the liberty to revisit the original work and added some of my new thoughts that could be interesting for the generation of scientists who are entering the intriguing arena of monoliths and may want to know the roots of the field. The current monolithic columns that are well applicable for efficient separations, were first described less than 30 years ago, and their advent represented the initial step to their present widespread appearance. At the beginning, the monolithic columns dominated the academic studies. However, several monolithic materials have later been materialized in commercial products. In order to stay within a reasonable size of this contribution, its focus is placed on developments achieved in the previous century. The very early reports are described in more detail since it might be difficult to find the original source.},

  abstract = {The production of olive oil and wine are two of the main agri-food economic activities in Southern Europe. They generate large amounts of solid and liquid wastes (e.g., olive pomace, olive mill wastewater, grape pomace, grape stems, wine lees, and wine processing wastewater) that represent a major environmental problem. Consequently, the management of these residues has become a big challenge for these industries, since they are harmful to the environment but rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols. In recent years, the recovery of phenolic compounds has been proposed as a smart strategy for the valorization of these by-products, from a circular economy perspective. This review aims to provide a comprehensive description of the state of the art of techniques available for the analysis, extraction, and purification of polyphenols from the olive mill and winery residues. Thus, the integration and implementation of these techniques could provide a sustainable solution to the olive oil and winery sectors.},

  abstract = {Heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine) and several important extraction and synthesis impurities (morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, codeine and 6-acetylcodeine) were determined in illicit drug samples, using high performance liquid chromatography with 'parallel segmented flow', which enabled the simultaneous use of three complementary modes of detection (UV-absorbance, tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium (III) chemiluminescence and permanganate chemiluminescence). This rapid and sensitive approach for the analysis of street heroin was used to explore the chemistry of a proposed heroin screening test that is based on the relative response with these two chemiluminescence reagents using flow injection analysis. Although heroin was the major constituent of the six drug samples (between 16\% and 67\% by mass), the synthetic by-product 6-acetylcodeine (2.5-8.3\%) made a greater contribution to the total [Ru(bipy)(3)](3+) chemiluminescence response of the screening test. The signal with permanganate was primarily due to the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine (0.9-29\%), and was therefore indicative of the degree of sample degradation during clandestine manufacture or poor storage conditions prior to the drug seizure. In the second part of the screening test, the sample is treated with sodium hydroxide, which results in a large increase in the signal with permanganate, due to the rapid hydrolysis of heroin to 6-monoacetylmorphine. As the emission of these two reagents with morphinan-alkaloids and their derivatives largely depends on the substituent at the O-3 position, the slower hydrolysis of 6-monoacetylmorphine to morphine, and 6-acetylcodeine to codeine, did not have a major impact on the characteristic pattern of responses in the screening test.

  abstract = {The complexity of synthetic and natural polymers used in industrial and medical applications is expanding; thus, it becomes increasingly important to improve and develop methods for their molecular characterization. Free-solution capillary electrophoresis is a robust technique for the separation and characterization of both natural and synthetic complex charged polymers. In the case of polyelectrolytes, free-solution capillary electrophoresis is in the “critical conditions” (CE-CC): it allows their separation by factors other than molar mass for molar masses typically higher than 20000 g/mol. This method is thus complementary to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC is widely used to determine molar mass distributions and their dispersities. Utilizing CE-CC, an analogous calculation of dispersity based on the distributions of electrophoretic mobilities was derived and the heterogeneity of composition or branching in different polysaccharides or synthetic polymers was obtained in a number of experimental cases. Calculations are based on a ratio of moments and could therefore be compared to simulations of polymerization processes, in analogy to the work performed on molar mass distributions. Among four possible types of dispersity, the most precise values were obtained with the calculation analogous with the dispersity of molar mass distribution Mw/Mn. In addition, the dispersity value allows conclusions based on a single value: the closer the dispersity is to 1, the more homogeneous the polymer is in terms of composition or branching. This approach allows the analysis of dispersity of important molecular attributes of polymers other than molar mass and aims at improving the overall molecular characterization of both synthetic and natural polymers. The dispersity can also be monitored online while performing a chemical reaction within the CE instrument.},

The accurate extraction of meaningful features and the building of discriminant models are two crucial steps in the data analysis pipeline of untargeted metabolomics. In this study, pure ion chromatograms were extracted from a liquor dataset and left-sided colon cancer (LCC) dataset by K-means-clustering-based Pure Ion Chromatogram extraction method version 2.0 (KPIC2). Then, the nonlinear low-dimensional embedding by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) showed the separation of samples from different groups in reduced dimensions. The discriminant models were established by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based on the features extracted by KPIC2. Results showed that features extracted by KPIC2 achieved 100\% classification accuracy on the test sets of the liquor dataset and the LCC dataset, which demonstrated the rationality of the XGBoost model based on KPIC2 compared with the results of XCMS (92\% and 96\% for liquor and LCC datasets respectively). Finally, XGBoost can achieve better performance than the linear method and traditional nonlinear modeling methods on these datasets. UMAP and XGBoost are integrated into KPIC2 package to extend its performance in complex situations, which are not only able to effectively process nonlinear dataset but also can greatly improve the accuracy of data analysis in non-target metabolomics.},

  abstract = {Coffee is a ubiquitous food product of considerable economic importance to the countries that produce and export it. The adulteration of roasted coffee is a strategy used to reduce costs. Conventional methods employed to identify adulteration in roasted and ground coffee involve optical and electron microscopy, which require pretreatment of samples and are time-consuming and subjective. Other analytical techniques have been studied that might be more reliable, reproducible, and widely applicable. The present review provides an overview of three analytical approaches (physical, chemical, and biological) to the identification of coffee adulteration. A total of 30 published articles are considered. It is concluded that despite the existence of a number of excellent studies in this area, there still remains a lack of a suitably sensitive and widely applicable methodology able to take into account the various different aspects of adulteration, considering coffee varieties, defective beans, and external agents.},

However, the computational skills needed to collect, manipulate, and evaluate data have not always been a focus of educational programs, and the increasing interest in “data science” suggest that data literacy has become paramount to ensure valid estimation. In this article, we first motivate such practical concerns for the modern epidemiology student, particularly as it relates to challenges in causal inference; second, we discuss how such concerns may be manifested in typical epidemiological analyses and identify the potential for bias; third, we present a case study that exemplifies the entire process; and finally, we draw attention to resources that can help epidemiology students connect the theoretical underpinning of the science to the practical considerations as described herein.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive multidimensional separations are today dominated by systems that are fundamentally limited to highly asymmetrical online separations sacrificing separation space, or to lengthy, time consuming offline separations. With the exception of pulse-modulated methods, separations have thus been limited to two dimensions. It is proposed that some of the limitations and shortcomings of these methods may be ameliorated or overcome by employing multi-dimensional detection whereby each analyte is effectively labelled in the frequency domain by a series of pulsed-injections, and a symmetrical, comprehensive online analysis performed with the resulting signal processed by sequential Fourier analysis. A semi-empirical computer model of this system was developed and its feasibility positively demonstrated in simulations of high-efficiency separations in two dimensions. Separations of higher dimensionality were shown to be possible but involved signal-processing challenges beyond the present work. By eliminating wrap-around effects and enabling the separation of physically unseparated peaks, the technique facilitates significant improvements in peak capacity per unit of analysis time as well as greatly improved signal to noise ratios. Because these comprehensive online multidimensional Fourier transform separations depend heavily upon the practical lifetime of imposed injection pulses, it is envisaged that this method will leverage emerging high-efficiency micro- and nanoscale separations technologies.

A system, as the one presented herein, for raw food categorization is needed in future food industries to automate food classification according to type, the process of algorithm approaches that will be applied to every different food origin and also for serving disabled people. The purpose of this work was to develop a machine learning workflow based on supervised PLS regression and SVM classification, towards automated raw food categorization from FTIR. The system exhibited high efficiency in multi-class classification of 7 different types of raw food. The selected food samples, were diverse in terms of storage conditions (temperature, storage time and packaging), while the variability within each food was also taken into account by several different batches; leading in a classifier able to embed this variation towards increased robustness and efficiency, ready for real life applications targeting to the digital transformation of the food industry.},

Slurry-packing techniques were applied to a series of interconnected short columns, with the columns situated intermediate between the inlet and outlet ends of the series being used for separations. The fast separation and determination of inorganic anions was achieved using short (4 mm ID, 30 mm long) columns packed with Dionex AS20 high-capacity anion-exchange stationary phase. Seven inorganic anions (bromate, chloride, chlorate, nitrate, sulfate, chromate and perchlorate) are separated in 2.6 min using a hydroxide gradient and a flow-rate of 1.8 mL/min (total analysis time including re-equilibration was 3.5 min). Under isocratic conditions, the home-packed columns exhibited efficiency values of 43,000 N/m for chloride at a flow-rate of 0.3 mL/min, compared to 54,000 N/m for a commercial 250 mm AS20 column at the same flow-rate. However, the short columns gave approximately a threefold higher sample throughput. The short, home-packed columns could be produced reproducibly and gave consistent performance over extended periods of usage.},

The RP-LC approach could not separate the isomers β and γ. The developed SFC-DAD method was precise, accurate, and most importantly more environmentally friendlier compared to the RP-LC method due to the 125-fold decrease in methanol consumption. The present study illustrated the selectivity differences between LC and SFC and how the C18 column can be used for tocopherol characterization.

In this report we describe a modification based on pre-generation of the ABTS radical anions with a thermolabile azo compound, 2,2′-azobis- (2-amidinopropane)HCl (ABAP). This modification makes the assay less susceptible to artefacts, e.g. influence on the radical generation process. For most antioxidants tested, a biphasic reaction pattern was seen, i.e. a fast and slow scavenging rate. We evaluated application of the assay with both lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds with antioxidant capacity. Several organic solvents, compatible with water, were tested with α-tocopherol, quercetin and β-carotene. It was found that the TEACs differed in various solvents. Under standardized conditions additivity of TEACs obtained from individual antioxidants could be demonstrated. This might enable application of the assay for the identification of “unknown” antioxidants.},

Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient’s HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005. Results: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379 872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22 744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2 689 287 (median, 8.4 y/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95\% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16\%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age. Limitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years. Conclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population” (21).},

Linear partial least squares (PLS) and non-linear least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) were implemented to predict relevant physical attributes in grapevine organs. NIR-RS using XGBoost showed coefficients of determination in validation (R2val) of 91.01\% and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.71 mm (6.80\%) for berry diameter. Shoot diameter was predicted at R2val of 62.08\% and RMSEP at 0.82 mm (12.75\%) using NIR-RS with LASSO regression. Monitoring these attributes throughout the growing season could lead to important viticultural information on grapevine yield, growth, and health.},

This was done to compare the relative selectivity and separation between the three separation modes and to evaluate the potential benefits of SFC separations with regards to resolution, throughput, economic and environmental impact. It was established that the separation of D- and L- FMOC amino acids in SFC displayed behaviours that were similar to both normal phase and reversed phase, rather than distinctly one or the other. Additionally, although reversed phase conditions yielded significantly higher resolution values between enantiomers across the range of amino acids studied, improvements in selectivity in SFC via the introduction of higher concentrations of formic acid in the mobile phase allowed for better resolution per unit of time. Moreover since the SFC mobile phase is composed mostly of recyclable CO2, there is a reduction in organic solvent consumption, which minimises the economic and environmental costs. © 2017},

The retention behaviour of these PAHs in SFC was compared to their behaviour in HPLC and there were very distinct differences. On the Synergi-polar stationary phase the PAH selectivity was highly dependent on the methanol modifier concentration, but in comparison on the Cosmosil column, the selectivity between the members of this PAH test group showed almost no change as a function of the methanol concentration, even though the retentivity on the Cosmosil stationary phase was far greater than the Synergi stationary. In fact, the mobile phase played a very passive role in the separations observed on the Cosmosil stationary phase. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

These tannins can come from different origins, which affect their composition and characteristics. The two main sources of oenological tannins are grapes and oak wood. This review describes methods to quantify and characterise oenological tannins and indicates that these methods also need to be improved. These tannins have different interactions with proteins as well as with wine components such as anthocyanins and other phenolics in wine. The suppliers of commercial tannins often emphasise that these products can stabilise colour in red wine and influence the mouthfeel of the wine, among other things. The literature, however, suggests that the addition of these tannins often does not lead to large differences in the chemical profile of the wine and sometimes even leads to unwanted sensory characters being observed in the wine. More research clearly is needed regarding the role of oenological tannins in wine.},

The prior has lead to improving the means for wine traceability, and discrimination and classification of grapes and wines (mainly in terms of grape varieties, geographical origin and processing conditions).

Caffeine, chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) and melanoidin content was also quantified. The data were analysed by principal component analysis. The AA values derived from the various methods used were correlated. Roasting resulted in the degradation of 5-CQA and formation of melanoidins, while AA was largely unaffected by roasting. The extraction of soluble coffee more prominently affected the AA of light-roasted coffee, mainly because it favoured the extraction of 5-CQA. The larger caffeine content in robusta coffee resulted in greater AA. All of soluble coffee products studied possessed antioxidant potential, which was conferred by their concentrations of phenolic compounds, caffeine and melanoidins.},

The present study describes the development of a comprehensive online two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) approach to characterize hyaluronic acid and its acrylate derivatives (DS ranging from 0.4 to 3.1) in terms of molar mass and degree of substitution. In the first dimension of the 2D-LC method, separation according to chemical composition/DS was achieved by using a stepwise solvent gradient and a reversed phase C8 column. Fractions from the first dimension were automatically transferred to the second dimension comprising size exclusion chromatographic separation of the fractions according to molar mass. It was found that the hyaluronic acid derivatives were broadly distributed with regard to both chemical composition and molar mass. Fractions with different degrees of substitution were identified, and their molar mass distributions were determined. The study proved that comprehensive 2D-LC is a powerful approach to reveal the complex nature of hyaluronic acid and its derivatives.},

When comparing a total of 33 compounds between GRC and IC, the latter product contained a remarkable increase in 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural and carbohydrates, as well as a clear decrease in trigonelline, N-methylpyridinium, caffeine, caffeoylquinic acids and 2-furylmethanol. Furthermore, the current protocol was able to detect the subtle chemical differences between spray-dried and freeze-dried IC. The aforementioned metabolites could serve as target molecules in the attempt to preserve, as much as possible, the organoleptic and nutraceutical properties of GRC during the industrial drying processes used in the production of the two commercial types of IC.},

  abstract = {The free radical scavenging activity of 42 Spanish commercial wines was determined using the 2,2 -azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS•+). The ABTS•+ radical was generated enzymatically using a horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. The presence of wine phenolic compounds caused the absorbance of the radical to decay at 414 nm. The measurement conditions were optimised. The total phenolic content of wines ranged from 1262 to 2389 mg l−1 for red wines and 70 to 407 mg l−1 for white wines, expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The phenolic content of Sherry wines was similar to that of white wines. Optimum dilutions for white and Sherry wines were set up as a function of their total phenolic content (for total phenol index, TPI {$<$} 300 mg gallic acid per liter, dilution 2.5:10 to 5:10; for TPI {$>$} 300 mg gallic acid per liter, dilution 1:10 to 3:10). Red wines absorb at the wavelength of measurement and dilutions between 0.35:10 and 0.1:10 are advisable. Reaction kinetics were also monitored and the antioxidant activity, expressed as Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), was determined at 2 and 15 min of reaction. The mean values for TEAC2 min were 5.01 ± 1.40 mM for red wines, 0.46 ± 0.32 mM for white wines and 0.26 ± 0.19 mM for Sherry wines. At 15 min, mean values were 6.93 ± 2.41 mM for red wines, 0.67 ± 0.47 mM for white wines and 0.26 ± 0.19 mM for Sherry wines. The correlation coefficients were better at 2 min (r = 0.9012) than at 15 min (r = 0.8462) when compared with TPI. Hence, TEAC2 min seems to be a more appropriate measure.},

  abstract = {Currently, the main role of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in wine is to conduct the malolactic fermentation (MLF). This process can increase wine aroma and mouthfeel, improve microbial stability and reduce the acidity of wine. A growing number of studies support the appreciation that LAB can also significantly, positively and negatively, contribute to the sensorial profile of wine through many different enzymatic pathways. This is achieved either through the synthesis of compounds such as diacetyl and esters or by liberating bound aroma compounds such as glycoside-bound primary aromas and volatile thiols which are odorless in their bound form. LAB can also liberate hydroxycinnamic acids from their tartaric esters and have the potential to break down anthocyanin glucosides, thus impacting wine color. LAB can also produce enzymes with the potential to help in the winemaking process and contribute to stabilizing the final product. For example, LAB exhibit peptidolytic and proteolytic activity that could break down the proteins causing wine haze, potentially reducing the need for bentonite addition. Other potential contributions include pectinolytic activity, which could aid juice clarification and the ability to break down acetaldehyde, even when bound to SO               2               , reducing the need for SO               2               additions during winemaking. Considering all these findings, this review summarizes the novel enzymatic activities of LAB that positively or negatively affect the quality of wine. Inoculation strategies, LAB improvement strategies, their potential to be used as targeted additions, and technological advances involving their use in wine are highlighted along with suggestions for future research.},

Different types of separations modes, i.e., hydrophobic and charge separation mechanisms, have been applied to increase the selectivity and peak capacity and to approach orthogonal separation mechanisms. The first-dimension separations were carried out by either reversed-phase chromatography or strong anion exchange chromatography. The second-dimension separation was in all cases reversed-phase capillary LC. In case of two-dimensional reversed/reversed-phase separations, some degree of orthogonality was achieved by using either two different sets of mobile phase solvents and one reversed-phase capillary LC column or a single set of mobile phases and two capillary LC columns packed with different-reversed-phase stationary phases. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was conducted to confirm the orthogonality of the developed two-dimensional capillary LC technique. The analysis of tryptic digests of cytochrome C and fetuin and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide mixture are described. ©1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The complementary mobile phases (CMPs) are selected in such a way that each one resolves optimally only some compounds in the mixture, while the remainder, resolved by the other mobile phase(s), can overlap among them. The methodology is based on the computation of a peak purity measurement for each solute, using an asymmetrical peak model for peak simulation. Two global resolution criteria (product of elementary resolutions and worst elementary resolution) and two methods for solving the problem (a systematic examination of all possible solute arrangements, and the use of genetic algorithms to expedite the calculation time) were used to find the optimal CMPs. The CMP optimisation methodology was applied to the resolution of a mixture of 10 diuretics and b-blockers, which could not be resolved using a single mobile phase; virtual baseline resolution was achieved, however, with two CMPs. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Much of biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study’s generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, caseecontrol, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, caseecontrol, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies. Ó 2007 The authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study consisting of 4311 COVID-19 adult (18 years and older) inpatients at 5 Johns Hopkinsaffiliated hospitals between 1 March and 3 December 2020. Malnourishment was identified using the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), then confirmed by registered dietitians. Statistics were conducted with SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) software to examine the effect of malnutrition on mortality and hospital length of stay among COVID-19 inpatient encounters, while accounting for possible covariates in regression analysis predicting mortality or the log-transformed length of stay. Results: COVID-19 patients who were older, male, or had lower BMIs had a higher likelihood of mortality. Patients with malnutrition were 76\% more likely to have mortality (p {$<$} 0.001) and to have a 105\% longer hospital length of stay (p {$<$} 0.001). Overall, 12.9\% (555/4311) of adult COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with malnutrition and were associated with an 87.9\% increase in hospital length of stay (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: In a cohort of COVID-19 adult inpatients, malnutrition was associated with a higher likelihood of mortality and increased hospital length of stay.},

  abstract = {The present work focuses on the application of multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) for analysis of five important antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadizine and sulfamerazine) in highly complex wastewater samples, using solid phase extraction (SPE)-high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) on a short column, regarding the fast elution methodology. The samples were pre-concentrated on Bond Elut-ENV cartridges and separated on an ODS column (7cm) in less than 4min using an isocratic mode of elution with methanol–water (55:45, v/v) at pH=3.2. Due to the matrix interferences and the resulting sensitivity changes, a strategy implementing standard addition calibration in combination with MCR/ALS algorithm was applied. In this paper, the signal corresponding to background contribution was considered as a systematic part of the model during MCR/ALS data processing, so the background correction step was not necessary. The qualitative and quantitative results showed that the application of MCR/ALS algorithm in the traditional chromatographic method was appropriately able to resolve highly drifted background constituents as well as heavily overlapped peaks among the analytes and also between the analytes and the matrix interferences. Recoveries were ranged from 69.6\% to 120.3\% with relative standard deviations of less than or equal to 11.0\% and showed the acceptable performance of the method. Additionally, statistical t-test as well as computed elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) confirmed the accuracy of the proposed method and indicated the absence of both constant and proportional errors in the predicted concentrations. The results well explained that the second-order advantage for analytes was achieved in samples containing one or more uncalibrated components, which strongly related to wastewater samples.},

  abstract = {The traceability of agro-products are very crucial as the food with know and guaranteed origin charged a high premium; meanwhile, the authenticity of the food product is also very necessary, since the adulteration of agro-products with cheap ingredients or chemicals pose a serious health threat to the consumer. Therefore there is clearly need to demonstrate these authenticity problems by modern analytical techniques. This review attempted to highlight the current overview in the application of analytical techniques such as liquid and gas chromatography, isotope ratio and elemental analysis, spectroscopic, DNA based and sensor technologies for the authentication of food of plant origin, with a special focus on geographical origin traceability and authenticity during the last five years. Papers cited here mainly include fruits, cereals, pulses, tea, coffee, spices, edible oil, fruit juices, and alcoholic beverages. The effectiveness of these techniques in laboratory and industrial level and also their advantages and drawbacks are discussed.},

Resources obtained through fraudulent means are likely to be viewed as unearned gains and are less likely to be invested in productive activities, such as recruiting talent. We posit that honest and fraudulent companies also invest in different types of innovation: honest firms pursue technically significant innovations, while fraudulent companies are likely to make smaller investments in less challenging inventive opportunities that contribute to the appearance rather than the substance of innovation. We test these predictions in a longitudinal dataset tracking the personnel recruitment and patenting activities of 467 Chinese high technology firms, all of which applied for state-funded innovation grants. We identify fraud by comparing two sets of financial books prepared by each company in the data in the same fiscal year, which are legally required to be identical but are discrepant in over 50 percent of cases, in a direction that benefits the firm. We find that relative to honest companies, fraudulent firms are more likely to receive state grants and are less likely to recruit new employees or produce important inventions in the post-grant period.},

  abstract = {Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), which employs pressurized carbon dioxide as the major component of the mobile phase, has been known for several decades but has faced a significant resurgence of interest in the recent years, thanks to the development of modern instruments to comply with current expectations in terms of robustness and sensitivity. This review is focused on the recent literature, specifically since the introduction of modern systems but in relation to older literature, to identify the changing trends in application domains. Typically, natural products, bioanalysis, food science, and environmental analyses are all strongly increasing. Together with reduced extra-column volumes in the instruments, the advent of sub-2-μm particles and superficially porous particles in the stationary phases is favoring ultra-high-performance SFC (UHPSFC) allowing for improved resolution and faster analyses, but without the constraints of viscous liquids encountered in ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Hyphenation to mass spectrometry is also more frequent and opened the way to new application domains, and raises different issues from liquid chromatography mobile phases, especially due to decompression of carbon dioxide. It is also shown that the frontiers between SFC and HPLC are fading, as switching from one method to the other, even within the course of a single analysis, is facilitated my modern instruments. The present review is not intended to be exhaustive but rather giving a snapshot of recent trends in supercritical fluid chromatography, based on the observation of about 500 papers published in English-written peer-reviewed journals from 2014 to 2018.},

Elements in the trace range (100-5000 µg L-1: Cu, Fe, Sr and Zn) and ultra-trace range (1-10 µg L-1: Cr, Ni, Pb and Sn) were analysed by ICP-MS and results from MICal were compared to conventional internal standard (ISTD) calibration measurements. Analysis of three wines (a red, white and rosé) for Fe and Cu by MICal yielded concentrations that were 100-112\% of concentrations established by consensus through a proficency testing program, but with much less variability than concentrations measured by either ISTD or consensus results. The same wines spiked with Cu, Fe, Sr and Zn yielded recoveries of 80-106\%. Trace elements were measured in a set of 43 wines and ultra-trace elements in a second set of 63 wines by both ISTD and MICal. Close correlations were observed between the two methods for all elements, although there was a small but significant overestimation of Sr, Cr and Ni by MICal. The MICal method shows promise for the rapid analysis of elements in wine, but matrix interferences and isobaric interferences may still affect certain elements. These limitations, and potential remedies, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent (FCR) or Folin's phenol reagent or Folin–Denis reagent, also called the gallic acid equivalence method (GAE), is a mixture of phosphomolybdate  and phosphotungstate used for the colorimetric in vitro assay of phenolic and polyphenolic antioxidants.  It is named after Otto Folin, Vintilă Ciocâlteu, and Willey Glover Denis. The Folin-Denis reagent is prepared by mixing sodium tungstate and phosphomolybdic acid in phosphoric acid. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent is just a modification of the Folin-Denis reagent. The modification consisted of the addition of lithium sulfate and bromine to the phosphotungstic-phosphomolybdic reagent. [2]  The reagent does not measure only phenols, but will react with any reducing substance. It therefore measures the total reducing capacity of a sample, not just phenolic compounds. This reagent is part of the Lowry protein assay, and will also react with some nitrogen-containing compounds such as hydroxylamine and guanidine. The reagent has also been shown to be reactive towards thiols, many vitamins, the nucleotide base guanine, the trioses glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, and some inorganic ions. Copper complexation increases the reactivity of phenols towards this reagent.This reagent is distinct from Folin's reagent, which is used to detect amines and sulfur-containing compounds. A 1951 paper entitled "Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent" was the most cited paper in the 1945–1988 Science Citation Index, with 187,652 citations.},

  abstract = {Soils support a wide range of ecosystem services that underpin Earth system functioning. It is therefore essential that we have robust approaches to evaluate how anthropogenic perturbation affects soil quality and the delivery of these services. Metabolomics, the large-scale study of low molecular weight organic compounds in soil, offers one potential approach to characterise soils and evaluate the metabolic status of the soil biological community. The aims of the present study were to 1) characterise the soil metabolome across a contrasting range of soil types, 2) understand the relationships between common chemical and physical soil quality indicators and its metabolome, and 3) evaluate the discriminatory power of soil metabolomics and its potential use as a soil quality indicator. Nine different topsoils with 5 replications were collected along an altitudinal primary productivity gradient encompassing a wide range of soil types and land uses. Metabolites were extracted from soil using 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile:isopropanol:water and individual compounds identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) platform. Overall, 405 individual compounds were detected, of which 146 were positively identified, including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, nucleobases, sugar alcohols, lipids and a range of secondary metabolites. The concentration and profile of metabolites was found to vary greatly between the soil types. Further, the soils' metabolomic fingerprints correlated to a number of environmental factors, including pH, land-use, moisture and salinity. We also tentatively attributed soil-specific metabolites to potential functional pathways, although complementary proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches would be needed to provide definitive supporting evidence. In conclusion, soil metabolomics offers the potential to reveal the complex molecular networks and metabolic pathways operating in the soil microbial community and a means of evaluating soil function. Further work is now required to benchmark soil metabolomes under a wide range of management regimes so that they can be used for the quantitative assessment of soil quality.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Consumer perceptions and motivation for luxury consumption are extensively investigated in the existing literature, although studies have largely focused on branded products with not much attention given to luxury wine. The wine category is distinctive, and luxury wine consumption is notably different from other luxury products. Over the past 20 years, the luxury segment of the wine industry has experienced steady growth, yet understanding of consumer perceptions and motivation for luxury wine consumption is still underdeveloped. Using self-congruency theory, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework of the perceptions of, and motivation for, luxury wine consumption.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Using a scoping review approach, the current literature on luxury wine and luxury branded products is analyzed for existing gaps in understanding luxury wine consumption.                                         Findings               The conceptualization of luxury wine along with the perceptions, motivators and indicators for wine consumption are currently underdeveloped. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding what drives perceptions and motivators of luxury wine consumption.                                         Originality/value               Emerging from a scoping review of extant literature, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding consumers’ perceptions of luxury wine and motivations for consumption.

  abstract = {Educators in professional degree programs are charged with multiple responsibilities in the classroom and in practice settings. We apply our professional knowledge in a variety of settings to serve our communities; we reflect on how to improve practice from our experiences in these settings; we observe our students engaging in learning experiences in the classroom; and we share with our students the knowledge we've gained from our experiences and our scholarship within our profession. To accomplish these actions we must serve as both teacher and learner in both classroom and field. Moreover, we want our students to also benefit from the active learning processes of applying, reflecting, sharing, and observing both in and out of the classroom while also functioning as both learners and teachers. Although we can accomplish all these goals over an entire curriculum, this article seeks to provide an example of one teacher's attempt to achieve these goals within a single Social Work course in Death and Grief. A model is provided that demonstrates how the interactive process works for both the teacher and students in this course and could be adapted for use in other courses incorporating practice settings as part of the curricula. Educators in professional or service-related fields desire their students not only to learn theory and understand why theories are important but also to learn how to apply the theoretical frameworks in practice. Too often we hear anecdotal accounts of students in internships who are unable to make this transition from theory to practice with confidence and effectiveness. Perhaps the difficulty in making the transition from theory to practice arises, at least in part, from a failure of the teacher to integrate both theory and practice into the same course in the curriculum in ways that are relevant and meaningful to the student. Such integration helps students to more closely associate the practical value of learning theoretical concepts. It is imperative that students in professional programs be able to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom. As Hutchings (1990) wrote, "What's at stake is the capacity to perform, to put what one knows into practice (p. 1)." To help students become capable and competent practitioners requires that they have training in self-awareness, knowledge acquisition, and skill building (Kramer, 1998). According to Shebib (2003), practitioners need to have skills in four areas: relationship building, exploring or probing, empowering, and challenging. An essential additional skill is the ability to gain and utilize knowledge from practice (Dorfman, 1996). Mendenhall (2007) says that in order for students to develop these skills, education at the master's level, as well as practical experience, is necessary and expected. What can we do in our classrooms to increase student success, not only in their internships but most importantly in work settings following graduation? How can we use classroom teaching to enhance the ability of students to put what they've learned into practice, and how can we use that improved practice to enhance classroom learning? As Fiszer (2004) states in his book How Teachers Learn Best, "The resulting data point to the need for an ongoing professional development model that directly connects training and practice" (p. 1). It is the goal of this article to describe how this classroom/practice/classroom process can be incorporated into a curriculum via an enhanced learning model, even in courses not centered on clinical, internship, or service-learning requirements. The course used to illustrate this process is a course in Death and Grief in Contemporary Society taught at an accredited BSW/MSW Social Work program at a private university in the Midwest section of the United States. Before describing the process, we will discuss the value of integrating practical experience into a curriculum and discuss the learning methods upon which the model is based.}

The book contains 10 chapters, each discussing different aspect of phenomena occurring when materials are exposed to ambient air which contains oxygen, ozone, singlet oxygen, and many other oxidizing species (radicals). The introduction includes discussion of general concepts related to antioxidants and their application. This is followed in Chapter 2 by information on existing natural and synthetic antioxidants which are presented in form of tables characterizing their general properties and applications. Chapter 3 contains a discussion of formation and action of oxidizing species in living organisms, ambient air, industrial environment, and chemical reactions. Essential aspects of physics and chemistry related to the oxidizing species are discussed here. Chapter 4 is devoted to the theories and mechanisms of stabilization according to which antioxidants perform in various environments. Suggestions are made on typical conditions of performance and potential use in different fields of application. Stability of antioxidants and its performance indicators, important for predicting the lifetime of antioxidant protection are discussed in Chapter 5. Different reasons for instability are pointed out in the evaluation. Principles of antioxidants selection are given in Chapter 6, including the influence of stabilizer properties and expectations from the final products. Chapters 7 and 8 give specific information on degradation and stabilization of different polymers \& rubbers and final products manufactured from them, respectively. The subjects discussed in each case of polymer or group of products are given in Table of Contents. Specific effects of antioxidants on other components of formulation in Chapter 9. Analytical methods, which are most frequently used in oxidation and its prevention, are discussed in Chapter 10 to show their potential in further understanding of the subject. This book is an excellent companion to the Databook of Antioxidants which has also been published recently. Both books supplement each other without repeating the same information--one contains data another theory, mechanisms of action, practical effects and implications of application"--},

  abstract = {Efficient membrane filtration requires the understanding of the membrane foulants and the functional properties of different membrane types in water purification. In this study, deadend filtration of aquaculture system effluents was performed and the membrane foulants were investigated via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Several machine learning models (Random Forest; RF, Extreme Gradient Boosting; XGBoost, Support Vector Machine; SVM, and Neural Network; NN) were constructed, one to predict the maximum transmembrane pressure, for revealing the chemical compounds causing fouling, and the other to classify the membrane materials based on chemometric analysis of NMR spectra, for determining their effect on the properties of the different membrane types tested. Especially, RF models exhibited high accuracy; the important chemical shifts observed in both the regression and classification models suggested that the proportional patterns of sugars and proteins are key factors in the fouling progress and the classification of membrane types. Therefore, the proposed strategy of chemometric analysis of NMR spectra is suitable for membrane research, which aims at investigating comprehensively the fouling phenomenon and how the foulants and environmental conditions vary according to the filtration systems.},

In the present study, we introduce a highly sensitive method that enables the determination of AA in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC/MS/MS). The sensitivity of the SFC/MS/MS technique is 11-times higher than that obtained by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the highly sensitive SFC/MS/MS method was able to quantify low concentrations of AA in beverages (i.e., roasted barley tea and coffee) extracts at less than 10 µg kg−1 level without solid-phase purification. Furthermore, the simplification of the sample preparation procedure provided an improvement in data acquisition time (60 samples per 12 h). In conclusion, the developed analytical system is a potentially useful tool for practical AA determination.},

  abstract = {A novel fluorescence application for simultaneous determination of two common fungicide pesticides (carbendazim and chlorothalonil) in peanut oil is presented. Using the strategy of combining excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence with three-way calibration methods, the proposed approach successfully achieved quantitative analysis of carbendazim and chlorothalonil pesticide residues in peanut oil, even with highly overlapped spectra. It needs little preparation, using "mathematical separation" instead of "analytical separation" to achieve concentration prediction of target analytes in complex systems. Each analyte was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy after instrument spectral correction and scatter removal. Then the data were modeled with two three-way calibration algorithms, including alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) and alternating penalty trilinear decomposition (APTLD). The results indicated that APTLD performed slightly better than ATLD for this system. The carbendazim and chlorothalonil can be recognized simultaneously with the correlation coefficients all above 0.96 between resolved spectra and actual spectra. Satisfactory results have been achieved with the average recoveries (mean\,±\,standard deviation) of carbendazim and chlorothalonil being 100.2\,±\,6.7\% and 99.7\,±\,6.7\%, respectively. Moreover, as for carbendazim and chlorothalonil, the sensitivity (SENs) are 1.50\,×\,102 and 3.80\,×\,102\,mL\,ng-1, the limits of detection (LODs) are 11\,ng\,mL-1 and 4.3\,ng\,mL-1, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) are 33.33\,ng\,mL-1 and 13.03\,ng\,mL-1, respectively. The above results demonstrated that the proposed method is sensitive, fast and accurate for direct quantitative analysis of multiple pesticide residues in complex matrix such as that of peanut oil.},

This 2-D algorithm was directly applied to total ion counts (TIC) chromatographic profiles of homogeneous chemical samples, i.e., samples including mostly identical compounds. For heterogeneous chemical samples, the 2-D algorithm is first applied to certain selected ion counts chromatographic profiles, and the resultant warping parameters are then used to warp the corresponding TIC chromatographic profiles. The developed 2-D COW algorithm can also be applied to align other 2-D separation images, e.g., LC x LC data, LC x GC data, GC x GC data, LC x CE data, and CE x CE data.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the application of chemometrics coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC–DAD) for the rapid and sensitive quantitative analysis of seven flavonoids in the raw and purified propolis samples was investigated. The objective of this paper was to receive a successful resolution of the complex propolis matrix with minimum experimental time (3.5 min) when appearing unknown interferences, highly overlapping peaks, time and baseline drifts among chromatograms. First, the validation samples contained seven flavonoids at five levels, helped to understand and interpret the features of the second-order calibration method based on the alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) algorithm. Second, the experimental data were studied for the simultaneous determination of flavonoids in the raw and purified propolis samples using the function of "mathematical separation" of ATLD algorithm. Except for myricetin (MY), the average recoveries of other analytes were 95.79–105.82\% for the raw propolis samples, 94.41–108.06\% for the purified propolis samples. In addition, the limit of detection (LOD, 0.01–0.20 μg m­ L−1), limit of quantification (LOQ, 0.03–0.60 μg ­mL−1), sensitivity (SEN, 15.97–184.31 mL μg−1), selectivity (SEL, 0.16–0.76) and root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP, 0.29–1.64 μg m­ L−1) of the proposed method, demonstrated that all the target analytes have good sensitivity, low detection limit. According to the experimental results, the total content of flavonoids in purified propolis is about twice that in raw propolis, which is consistent with the actual situation. This analytical strategy will be extremely promising for the identification and quantification of analytes studied in the complex samples.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive undergraduate experiment about extraction, separation, and identification of essential oils (EOs) from a natural plant is described. Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (ATR) was used as the raw plant material. Two devices (Soxhlet and Clevenger) with different extraction principles were employed for EO extraction from ATR, separately. The chemical compounds of the extracted EOs were separated and identified by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC−MS). The differences in the chemical components obtained by the two extraction devices were compared. The experiment can give students a deep insight into the difference between the extraction methods. Additionally, the experiment can enable students to learn how to use GC−MS to identify the chemical structures of the extracted complex samples. The grouped students who performed this experiment gained a deep understanding of extraction and detection techniques, as well as the benefits of teamwork.},

  abstract = {Time shift among samples remains a significant challenge in data analysis, such as quality control of natural plant extracts and metabolic profiling analysis, because this phenomenon may lead to invalid conclusions. In this work, we propose a new time shift alignment method, namely, automatic time-shift alignment (ATSA), for complicated chromatographic data analysis. This technique comprised the following alignment stages: (1) automatic baseline correction and peak detection stage for providing useful chromatographic information; (2) preliminary alignment stage through adaptive segment partition to correct alignment for the entire chromatogram; and (3) precise alignment stage based on test chromatographic peak information to accurately align time shift. In ATSA, the chromatographic peak information of both reference and test samples can be completely employed for time-shift alignment to determine segment boundaries and avoid loss of information. ATSA was used to analyze a complicated chromatographic dataset. The obtained correlation coefficients among samples and data analysis efficiency indicated that the influences of time shift can be considerably reduced by ATSA; thus accurate conclusion could be obtained.},

  abstract = {Food fraud is currently a growing global concern with far-reaching consequences. Food authenticity attributes, including biological identity, geographical origin, agricultural production, and processing technology, are susceptible to food fraud. Metabolic markers and their corresponding authentication methods are considered as a promising choice for food authentication. However, few metabolic markers were available to develop robust analytical methods for food authentication in routine control. Untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is increasingly used to discover metabolic markers. This review summarizes the general workflow, recent applications, advantages, advances, limitations, and future needs of untargeted metabolomics by LC-MS for identifying metabolic markers in food authentication. In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics by LC-MS shows great efficiency to discover the metabolic markers for the authenticity assessment of biological identity, geographical origin, agricultural production, processing technology, freshness, cause of animals’ death, and so on, through three main steps, namely, data acquisition, biomarker discovery, and biomarker validation. The application prospects of the selected markers by untargeted metabolomics require to be valued, and the selected markers need to be eventually applicable at targeted analysis assessing the authenticity of unknown food samples.},

This technique exploits a novel column end-fitting and an extra HPLC pump that delivers a reagent specific for selective detection, in particular the antioxidant profiling of natural products. This study employed RF for the first time to identify antioxidants in a commercial ginger sample. This demonstrated the previously validated assay's ease and power to extract information about the natural product's antioxidant properties. Due to the simplicity involved with data analysis and peak matching process, the following information was revealed between the chemical and antioxidant profiles: three of the strongest antioxidant activity peaks in the ginger sample (593nm) did not correlate with the three most abundant chemical profile peaks (UV absorbance at 254 and 280nm); the ratio of seven antioxidant peaks may be potentially used for food authenticity purposes, and future research should target these peaks for the early discovery of novel antioxidants sourced in ginger. Utilization of this previously validated assay provided the resolution of numerous peaks in the ginger extract and information associated with their antioxidant attributes and chemical abundance. This approach is more informative than total antioxidant assays that lack compound specificity information. Furthermore, it is superior to mass spectrometric (MS) assays that cannot evaluate each compound's antioxidant strength, and does not involve the expense involved in the acquisition and maintenance of the MS detection hardware, and does not require the high level of expertise needed to conduct the MS data analysis.},

  abstract = {We are in the STEM generation whose comprehensive purpose is to resolve (1) societal needs for new technological and scientific advances; (2) economic needs for national security; and (3) personal needs to become a fulfilled, productive, knowledgeable citizen. STEM specifically refers to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, but now has a broader meaning to include environment, economics, and medicine. Currently, there is not an agreement of the particulars in education, or in standards, by professional organizations that define STEM literacy. Most definitions do cover societal and economic needs but overlook personal needs. There is a general consensus that everyone needs to be STEM literate. But there is a difference between literacy and being literate. STEM literacy should not be viewed as a content area but as a deictic means (composed of skills, abilities, factual knowledge, procedures, concepts, and metacognitive capacities) to gain further learning. This paper gives a brief background of literacy definitions in STEM and presents a description of STEM literacy based upon (1) cognitive, (2) affective, and (3) psychomotor learning theory domains. The paper stresses the need to evolve from learning for STEM literacy to using STEM literacy for learning to satisfy our societal, economic, and personal needs.},

  abstract = {Wine is an extremely sophisticated chemical matrix in which the harmonious equilibria between many components (alcohols, acids, aromas, polyphenols, etc.) determine its final quality and value. The study of wine composition by metabolomic tools, referred as Wineomics, has emerged as a revolutionary approach to unravel the chemical space of wines and to associate wine composition with important viticultural and enological traits including grape variety, geographical origin, terroir or typicity.  One of the most promising applications of metabolomic tools for wine analysis is the study of wine traceability and authenticity, a major issue for the wine industry and consumers. These studies are extremely complex, because counterfeits are becoming more sophisticated and they require powerful techniques capable to detect subtle differences between wines. In this chapter, we describe the targeted and untargeted approaches by Mass and NMR spectrometry-based metabolomics as well as some recent examples of their abilities in wine authenticity studies.},

  abstract = {Rapid nondestructive testing of peanut seed vigor is of great significance in current research. Before seeds are sown, effective screening of high-quality seeds for planting is crucial to improve the quality of crop yield, and seed vitality is one of the important indicators to evaluate seed quality, which can represent the potential ability of seeds to germinate quickly and whole and grow into normal seedlings or plants. Meanwhile, the advantage of nondestructive testing technology is that the seeds themselves will not be damaged. In this study, hyperspectral technology and superoxide dismutase activity were used to detect peanut seed vigor. To investigate peanut seed vigor and predict superoxide dismutase activity, spectral characteristics of peanut seeds in the wavelength range of 400-1000 nm were analyzed. The spectral data are processed by a variety of hot spot algorithms. Spectral data were preprocessed with Savitzky-Golay (SG), multivariate scatter correction (MSC), and median filtering (MF), which can effectively to reduce the effects of baseline drift and tilt. CatBoost and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree were used for feature band extraction, the top five weights of the characteristic bands of peanut seed vigor classification are 425.48nm, 930.8nm, 965.32nm, 984.0nm, and 994.7nm. XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest were used for modeling of seed vitality classification. XGBoost and partial least squares regression were used to establish superoxide dismutase activity value regression model. The results indicated that MF-CatBoost-LightGBM was the best model for peanut seed vigor classification, and the accuracy result was 90.83\%. MSC-CatBoost-PLSR was the optimal regression model of superoxide dismutase activity value. The results show that the R               2               was 0.9787 and the RMSE value was 0.0566. The results suggested that hyperspectral technology could correlate the external manifestation of effective peanut seed vigor.},
