The sample used to explore the fundamentals of the time series is sample 154 - 2020 leeuwin estate shiraz art series, an Australian Shiraz from Margaret River, Western Australia. A Shiraz has been selected because they, at least anecdotally, have the highest peak intensity and signal complexity, meaning that patterns in the data should be easy to detect.


```{python}
# get 154

# setup

import duckdb as db
from wine_analysis_hplc_uv import definitions
from wine_analysis_hplc_uv.notes.lib_eda.sample_standardisation.characterising_and_normalizing_time_axis import (
    data,
)

data.df_154.plot(x="mins", y="absorbance", title="154")
```
