# Preface {.unnumbered}

This chapter describes the experiment inspiration, background, acquisition and a cursory observation of results.

Hypothesis: the chromatographic signals collected from wines will be significantly different under raw and cuprac detection methods, where cuprac will contain more sample-to-sample variance than raw. Variance will be described through clustering (PCA?) where varietal classes will cluster together, with CUPRAC producing tighter clusters compared to raw.
