    "A notebook containing an analysis and consideration of whethre or not to remove a fitted baseline from all samples automatically. The outcome was that while there is an observable correlation between methanol AUC (Area Under Curve) and baseline AUC, it was decided that this was coincident on the fact that an increased %Me increases the pace of elution of components, in turn increasing the average baseline AUC, and that since white wines had little no observable baseline, that the source of the baseline is from the sample. We concluded by stating that baseline removal would be acceptable for inter-varietal studies, but generally advised against."

    "To answer the question of correlation between % methanol gradient and baseline AUC, it appears that they are tangentially related, and that apart from samples such as 17, the majority of components are eluting by the 30 minute mark, which is just over half way up the methanol gradient. In samples possessing high AUC relative to zero, such as 1, 2, 3, 8, 17, 47, 66, 84, 98, etc., the baseline becomes significant after the 5 minute mark, where methanol is > 12.5% of the mobile phase composition. It is the 5 to 30 minute range that would benefit from baseline removal."
