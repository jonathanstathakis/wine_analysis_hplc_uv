# Chapter 1 README

The README for the `chapter_one` module.

## Workflow

### Notebooks

Experimental notebooks are to be as independent as possible.

### Sections

The overarching section is 'chapter 1'. It is made up of subsections which quarto requires we refer to as chapters. THis may come back to bite me in the ass, but thats how its gna work for now. each subsection will be its own file, with its own outline, and its own bib file. The idea is to atomize everything to reduce both anxiety and dependency problems. The breakdown will be reflected in zotero as well.
