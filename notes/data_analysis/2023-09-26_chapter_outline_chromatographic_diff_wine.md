# Paper: Post Column Derivitization Detection of Red and White Wines with CUPRAC

A paper/thesis chapter discussing: separation of red and white wines through HPLC, detection of wines through UV/vis spectrometry, detection of those sames wines through CUPRAC PCD spectrophotometry, why the signal magnitudes differ between the PCD and raw signals, and hich is better for the intended purpose, i.e. chemotaxonomy.

Notes from meeting: First need to select a dataset by seperating out most represented classes then subset the data. Start with a description of the dataset, then discuss dataset robustness and finally library validation. The degredation data can be analyzed by first normalizing on a peak maxima. We should also look at column selectivity across wines.

Questions for Andrew Regarding this Paper: How much to focus on WHY the profiles look the way they do? What descriptive elements to compare the signals (i.e. peak tables)? What data treatement appropriate for display? i.e. baseline correction?
